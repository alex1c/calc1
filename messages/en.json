					},
					"howToCalculate": {
						"question": "How to calculate maximum heart rate?",

					},
					"trainingZones": {
						"question": "Which heart rate zones to use for training?",
						"answer": "For weight loss, use the 60-70% zone of maximum, for endurance development - 70-80%, for strength development - 80-90%. Beginners are recommended the 50-70% zone."
					},
					"safety": {
						"question": "Is it safe to train by heart rate?",
