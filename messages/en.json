						"question": "What is blood pressure?",
						"answer": "Blood pressure is the force with which blood presses against artery walls. It's measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and consists of two values: systolic (upper) and diastolic (lower)."
					},
					"normalRange": {
						"question": "What is considered normal pressure?",
						"answer": "Normal blood pressure is less than 130/85 mmHg. However, normal values can vary depending on age, gender, and individual characteristics."
					},
					"hypertension": {
						"question": "What is hypertension?",
						"answer": "Hypertension (high blood pressure) is a persistent increase in blood pressure above 140/90 mmHg. This is a serious condition requiring medical monitoring and treatment."
					},
					"measurement": {
						"question": "How often should I measure blood pressure?",
						"answer": "Healthy people are recommended to measure blood pressure once a year. With risk factors or deviations - more often, as recommended by a doctor. With hypertension - daily at the same time."
