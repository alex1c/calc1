          {
            "q": "What does 'Complex Compatibility' mean?",
            "a": "This does not mean that a relationship is impossible. Difficult compatibility (less than 50%) simply indicates potential difficulties that can be overcome with mutual desire and work on the relationship."
          },
          {
            "q": "How often can I use the calculator?",

          },
          {
            "q": "How does the toss animation work?",
            "a": "The animation is a visual effect of the coin spinning, which lasts about 300 milliseconds. This creates a realistic feeling of flipping a physical coin before displaying the result."
          },
          {
            "q": "Is it possible to export the results?",
            "a": "Currently, results can be copied to the clipboard, but direct export to a file is not available. You can manually save the copied text to a file for later use."
