              "q": "What is heart rate (HR)?",
              "a": "Heart rate is the number of heart beats per minute. This is an important indicator for monitoring the intensity of physical activity and assessing the state of the cardiovascular system. Measured in beats per minute (bpm or bpm)."
            },
            {
              "q": "How to calculate maximum heart rate?",
              "a": "Maximum heart rate is calculated using the formula: 220 minus age in years. For example, for a 30-year-old person, the maximum heart rate is 190 beats per minute (220 - 30 = 190). This is an approximate formula and individual values ​​may vary."
            },
            {
              "q": "Which heart rate zones should you use for training?",
              "a": "To lose weight, use the fat burning zone (60-70% of the maximum), to develop endurance - the aerobic zone (70-80%), to develop strength - the anaerobic zone (80-90%). Beginners are recommended to start from the rest area (50-70%)."
            },
            {
              "q": "Is it safe to train using your heart rate?",
              "a": "Yes, heart rate training is safe when done correctly. It is important to consult a doctor before starting intense training, start at a low intensity, constantly monitor how you feel, and not exceed your maximum heart rate."
            },
            {
              "q": "What is considered normal resting heart rate?",
              "a": "The normal resting heart rate for adults is 60-100 beats per minute. In trained athletes, the resting heart rate may be lower (40-60 beats/min). An elevated resting heart rate may indicate health problems."
            },
            {
              "q": "How to measure your heart rate during exercise?",
              "a": "You can measure your pulse manually (on your wrist or neck), but during training it is more convenient to use a heart rate monitor, fitness bracelet or sports watch. Measure your heart rate regularly during exercise to monitor intensity."
            },
            {
              "q": "What is the fat burning zone and why is it important?",
              "a": "The fat burning zone is 60-70% of maximum heart rate. In this zone, the body most effectively uses fat as a source of energy. Training in this zone is optimal for weight loss and can last longer than high-intensity training."
            },
            {
              "q": "How does the aerobic zone differ from the anaerobic zone?",
              "a": "Aerobic zone (70-80% of maximum) - this is training with access to oxygen, develops endurance. Anaerobic zone (80-90% of maximum) - training without sufficient oxygen, develops strength and speed, but requires more recovery."
            },

              "q": "How long should you train in each zone?",
              "a": "Fat burning zone: 30-60 minutes, aerobic zone: 20-60 minutes, anaerobic zone: 10-30 minutes (interval), maximum zone: short-term only (seconds to minutes) for experienced athletes."
            },
            {
              "q": "Is it possible to exceed your maximum heart rate?",
              "a": "Exceeding the maximum heart rate is possible, but dangerous to health. It is not recommended to exceed 100% of the calculated maximum, especially without preparation. If you feel unwell, immediately reduce the intensity."
            },
            {
              "q": "How is heart rate related to post-workout recovery?",
              "a": "A rapid recovery of heart rate after exercise (return to normal within 1-2 minutes) indicates good physical fitness. Slow recovery may indicate overtraining or health problems."
            },
            {
              "q": "What is the optimal heart rate for weight loss?",
              "a": "For weight loss, the fat burning zone is optimal (60-70% of maximum heart rate). In this zone, you can train longer, the body burns fat efficiently, and the workout is easier to tolerate than high-intensity training."
            },
            {
              "q": "Does age affect your heart rate during exercise?",
              "a": "Yes, maximum heart rate decreases with age. The formula \"220 - age\" takes this into account. Older people are recommended to lower the intensity of training and prioritize relaxation and fat burning areas."
            },
            {
              "q": "What is resting pulse and why measure it?",
              "a": "Resting pulse is your heart rate at rest (best measured in the morning after waking up). A decrease in resting heart rate over time indicates improved fitness. An increase may indicate overtraining or health problems."
            },
            {
              "q": "How to use heart rate for interval training?",
              "a": "Interval training alternates periods of high intensity (80-90% of maximum) and recovery (50-70% of maximum). For example, 1 minute in the anaerobic zone, then 2 minutes in the rest zone. This develops strength and endurance."
            },
            {
              "q": "Do you need a heart rate monitor for training?",
              "a": "A heart rate monitor is optional, but very useful for accurately monitoring the intensity of your workouts, especially for beginners. You can measure your heart rate manually, but this is less convenient during training."
            },
            {
              "q": "What heart rate is dangerous for health?",
              "a": "A pulse that significantly exceeds the maximum heart rate or causes symptoms: chest pain, severe shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea is considered dangerous. If these symptoms occur, stop exercising immediately and consult a doctor."
            },
            {
              "q": "How does the heart rate differ between men and women?",
              "a": "In women, the resting heart rate is usually slightly higher than in men (by 5-10 beats/min). The maximum heart rate formula \"220 - age\" is universal for both sexes, but women may have a slightly higher maximum heart rate."
            },
            {
              "q": "What to do if your heart rate is too high during exercise?",
              "a": "If your heart rate exceeds the target zone or you feel discomfort, reduce the intensity: slow down, pause, walk. It is important to listen to your body and not ignore signals."
            },
            {
              "q": "How to train by heart rate to develop endurance?",
              "a": "To develop endurance, train in the aerobic zone (70-80% of maximum) for 30-60 minutes. These workouts improve cardiovascular function, increase lung capacity and increase overall endurance."
            },
            {
              "q": "What is heart rate reserve and why is it needed?",
              "a": "Heart rate reserve = maximum heart rate - resting heart rate. This is the range that can be used for training. Calculation of zones based on heart rate reserve (Karvonen method) is more accurate than calculation based on maximum heart rate."
            },
            {
              "q": "How does heart rate change with different types of training?",
              "a": "When running, your heart rate is usually higher than when you walk or bike at the same perceived exertion. Swimming gives a lower heart rate due to the horizontal position. Strength training can cause short-term spikes in heart rate."
            },
            {
              "q": "Can I use the same zone for all workouts?",
              "a": "It is not recommended to use only one zone. A variety of zones in training (training in different heart rate zones) gives better results than monotonous training in one zone. Combine different zones in your training plan."
            },
            {
              "q": "How is heart rate related to resting heart rate in the morning?",
              "a": "Morning resting heart rate is an important indicator of recovery. If your morning heart rate is 5-10 beats per minute higher than usual, this may indicate insufficient recovery or the onset of illness. In such cases, it is worth reducing the load."
            },
            {
              "q": "What are heart rate zones for cardio training?",
              "a": "Heart rate zones for cardio training divide the range from rest to maximum into 5 zones: rest (50-60%), fat burning (60-70%), aerobic (70-80%), anaerobic (80-90%), maximum (90-100%). Each zone has its own goals and effects."
            },
            {
              "q": "How often should you train by heart rate?",
              "a": "For beginners: 3-4 times a week for 20-30 minutes in the fat burning zone. For those who are trained: 4-6 times a week with alternating zones (days of recovery in the rest zone, days of work in target zones). It is important to allow time for recovery."
            },
            {
              "q": "Can the heart rate calculator be used for children?",
              "a": "Formula \"220 - age\" is suitable for adults. For children and adolescents, other calculation methods are used. Children are advised to consult a pediatrician before starting intensive heart rate training."
            },
            {
              "q": "How does heart rate affect the effectiveness of training?",
              "a": "Training in the correct heart rate zone is more effective for achieving specific goals. Training at too low an intensity will have little effect, while training at too high an intensity can lead to overtraining and injury. The optimal zone depends on the goal."
            },
            {

            {
              "q": "What are fertile days?",
              "a": "Fertile days are the period when the likelihood of conception is highest. Usually this is 2-3 days before ovulation, the day of ovulation and 1 day after it. Sperm can live in a woman’s body for up to 5-7 days, so intercourse a few days before ovulation can also lead to conception."

              "q": "What is the normal length of the menstrual cycle?",
              "a": "The normal length of the menstrual cycle is 21-35 days, with an average of 28 days. A cycle is considered regular if its duration does not change by more than 2-3 days. The first day of the cycle is the first day of menstruation."
            },

              "q": "How accurate are the ovulation calculator calculations?",
              "a": "The calculator gives approximate results based on standard medical data. Accuracy depends on the regularity of your cycle. With a regular cycle, the accuracy is about 80-90%. If you have an irregular cycle, it is recommended to use additional methods to determine ovulation (tests, basal temperature) and consult a doctor."

            {
              "q": "How to calculate the day of ovulation?",
              "a": "The day of ovulation is calculated using the formula: Date of last menstruation + (Cycle length - 14) days. For example, with a 28-day cycle and the last menstruation on March 1: ovulation = March 1 + (28 - 14) = March 15. Ovulation usually occurs 14 days before the start of your next period."
            },
            {
              "q": "How to calculate fertile days?",
              "a": "Fertile days are calculated as follows: 2-3 days before ovulation, the day of ovulation and 1 day after ovulation. For example, if ovulation is on March 15, then fertile days are March 13-16 (4 days). This is the period of maximum probability of conception."
            },

              "q": "When will your next period start?",
              "a": "The next period begins the length of your cycle after your last period. For example, with the last menstruation on March 1 and a cycle of 28 days, the next menstruation will begin on March 29. The duration of menstruation is usually 3-7 days."

              "q": "Is it possible to get pregnant on the day of ovulation?",
              "a": "Yes, the day of ovulation is one of the most favorable days for conception. The probability of conception on the day of ovulation is maximum (up to 33%). However, to increase your chances, it is also recommended to try to conceive 2-3 days before ovulation, since sperm can live in the body for several days."

              "q": "Is it possible to get pregnant during menstruation?",
              "a": "Theoretically possible, but unlikely. The likelihood of conceiving during menstruation is very low, but not zero, especially with a short cycle (21-24 days) or early ovulation. Sperm can remain viable for up to 7 days, so fertilization is possible with a short cycle."
            },
            {
              "q": "What affects the day of ovulation?",
              "a": "The day of ovulation is affected by: stress, climate change, illness, medication, weight changes, physical activity, hormonal changes. These factors can push ovulation several days earlier or later, which reduces the accuracy of the calendar method."

              "q": "What is a short cycle and how does it affect ovulation?",
              "a": "The short cycle is 21-24 days. With this cycle, ovulation occurs earlier - usually on days 7-10 of the cycle. This is normal, but important to consider when planning a pregnancy. With a short cycle, the fertile period begins earlier."
            },
            {
              "q": "What is a long cycle and how does it affect ovulation?",
              "a": "The long cycle is 31-35 days or more. With this cycle, ovulation occurs later - usually 17-21 days or later. This is also normal. With a long cycle, the fertile period shifts accordingly, and menstruation comes later."
            },
            {
              "q": "How to keep a menstruation calendar?",
              "a": "Keep a calendar, noting: the first day of each menstruation, the duration of menstruation, the length of the cycle (the number of days from the first day of one menstruation to the first day of the next), well-being, signs of ovulation. Keep a calendar for at least 3-6 months to determine your average cycle length."

              "q": "What is an irregular cycle?",
              "a": "An irregular cycle is when your cycle length varies significantly (more than 7 days) between cycles. For example, one cycle is 25 days, the next is 35 days. If you have an irregular cycle, the calendar method is less accurate; it is recommended to consult a doctor and use other methods for determining ovulation."

              "a": "The calendar method (Ogino-Knaus method) has low effectiveness for prevention (Pearl index 9-25). It is not recommended as a primary method of contraception. For protection, it is better to use more reliable methods (condoms, hormonal contraceptives, IUDs)."
            },
            {
              "q": "How to improve the accuracy of ovulation calculations?",
              "a": "To increase accuracy: keep a menstrual calendar for at least 3-6 months, take into account the average length of the cycle, use additional methods (ovulation tests, basal temperature), monitor the signs of ovulation, take into account factors affecting the cycle (stress, illness)."
            },
            {
              "q": "When is the best time to take a pregnancy test after ovulation?",
              "a": "A pregnancy test can be taken no earlier than 10-14 days after ovulation (or after the expected date of the next menstruation). Earlier, the test may show a false negative result because the hCG level is still too low to detect."
            },
            {
              "q": "What is the luteal phase of the cycle?",
              "a": "The luteal phase is the period after ovulation until the next menstruation begins. Usually 12-16 days, average 14 days. If the luteal phase is shorter than 10 days, this may indicate problems with conception and requires consultation with a doctor."
            },
            {
              "q": "How does stress affect ovulation?",
              "a": "Stress can delay ovulation or make your cycle irregular. Under severe stress, ovulation may occur later than usual or not at all (anovulatory cycle). Stress management is important for cycle regularity and successful conception."
            },
            {
              "q": "What is an anovulatory cycle?",
              "a": "An anovulatory cycle is a menstrual cycle in which ovulation does not occur. Menstruation may come, but ovulation has not occurred. Such cycles can occur 1-2 times a year and are considered normal. Frequent anovulatory cycles require consultation with a doctor."
            },
            {
              "q": "How does age affect ovulation?",
              "a": "With age (after 35 years), ovulation may become irregular, cycles may lengthen or shorten. The number of eggs decreases, which affects fertility. Teenage girls may also have irregular cycles in the first years after menarche."
            },
            {
              "q": "Is it possible to get pregnant immediately after menstruation?",
              "a": "Possibly, especially with a short cycle. If the cycle is 21-24 days, and menstruation lasts 5-7 days, ovulation can occur as early as 7-10 days of the cycle. Sperm can live up to 7 days, so intercourse immediately after menstruation can lead to conception if you ovulate early."
            },
            {
              "q": "What is basal temperature and how to measure it?",
              "a": "Basal temperature is the body temperature at rest, measured immediately after waking up. During ovulation, the temperature rises by 0.3-0.5°C and remains elevated until menstruation. Measure your temperature in the morning, without getting out of bed, at the same time, with the same thermometer."
            },
            {
              "q": "How does an ovulation test work?",
              "a": "An ovulation test measures the level of luteinizing hormone (LH) in the urine. 24-36 hours before ovulation there is a surge in LH, which is recorded by the test. A positive test means that ovulation will occur within the next 24-36 hours. This is a more accurate method than the calendar method."
            },
            {
              "q": "How do ovulation signs help in calculation?",
              "a": "Signs of ovulation: pain in the lower abdomen (moderate pain), increased libido, changes in cervical mucus, increased basal temperature, positive ovulation test. The combination of the calendar method with observation of signs increases the accuracy of determining fertile days."
            },
            {
              "q": "What to do if you have an irregular cycle?",
              "a": "For an irregular cycle: keep a calendar for at least 6 months to determine the average length, use additional methods (tests, basal temperature), consult a gynecologist to identify the causes of irregularity, eliminate stress factors, normalize weight and nutrition."
            },
            {
              "q": "Do medications affect ovulation?",
              "a": "Yes, some medications can affect ovulation: hormonal drugs, antidepressants, anti-inflammatory drugs, chemotherapy. Oral contraceptives suppress ovulation. After canceling OK, the cycle may not be restored immediately. When taking medications, consider their effect on your cycle."
            },
            {
              "q": "How does diet affect ovulation?",
              "a": "Nutrition affects ovulation: nutritional deficiencies, crash diets, and being overweight or underweight can disrupt your cycle and ovulation. For normal ovulation, a balanced diet with sufficient amounts of proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals is important."
            },
            {
              "q": "When to see a doctor when planning pregnancy?",
              "a": "You should consult a doctor: if you have not been able to get pregnant for more than a year (or 6 months if you are over 35 years old), with an irregular cycle, in the absence of ovulation, with health problems affecting fertility. The doctor may prescribe examination and treatment."

            },
            {
              "q": "How does physical activity affect the need for vitamins?",
              "a": "With high physical activity, the need for B vitamins, vitamin C and some minerals increases by 10-20% due to accelerated metabolism, increased energy expenditure and increased sweating. B vitamins, vitamin C, magnesium and zinc are especially important for athletes."
            },
            {
              "q": "Do I need to take vitamin supplements?",
              "a": "With a balanced diet, most vitamins can be obtained from food. Supplements are only necessary for deficiency or special needs (pregnancy, intense exercise, chronic illness), as determined by a physician. You should not take vitamins without a prescription."
            },
            {
              "q": "How accurate are the calculator's calculations?",
              "a": "The calculator is based on WHO recommendations and takes into account the main factors (gender, age, activity). However, individual needs may vary depending on health conditions, medications, climate, and other factors. Consultation with a physician is important for an accurate assessment."
            },
            {
              "q": "What vitamins are the most important?",
              "a": "All vitamins are important, but of particular importance are: vitamin D (immunity, bones), vitamin C (immunity, antioxidant), B vitamins (energy, nervous system), vitamin A (vision, immunity), folic acid (hematopoiesis, pregnancy). A deficiency of any vitamin can lead to health problems."
            },
            {
              "q": "Why is vitamin deficiency dangerous?",
              "a": "Vitamin deficiency can lead to serious problems: lack of vitamin D - to osteoporosis and weakened immunity, vitamin B12 - to anemia and neurological problems, vitamin C - to scurvy and weakened immunity, vitamin A - to vision problems. It is important to identify and fill the deficit in a timely manner."
            },
            {
              "q": "Is it possible to overdose on vitamins?",
              "a": "Yes, an overdose of vitamins (especially fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, K) is dangerous. Water-soluble vitamins (B, C) are excreted in urine, but too much of them can also cause problems. Take vitamins only as recommended by your doctor and do not exceed the dosage."
            },
            {
              "q": "How does age affect the need for vitamins?",

            {
              "q": "Is it possible to get all vitamins from food?",
              "a": "With a balanced, varied diet, you can get most vitamins. However, some vitamins (D, B12) are difficult to obtain in sufficient quantities from food alone, especially in certain conditions (winter, vegetarianism, age). In such cases, supplements are needed."
            },
            {
              "q": "When is the best time to take vitamins?",
              "a": "Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) are best taken with a meal containing fat for better absorption. Water-soluble (B, C) can be taken on an empty stomach or with food. Multivitamins are usually taken in the morning or early afternoon with breakfast."
            },

            {
              "q": "Do children need vitamins?",
              "a": "Vitamins for growth and development are especially important for children: vitamin D (prevention of rickets), calcium (bone growth), iron (prevention of anemia), zinc (immunity, growth), vitamin A (vision). Children are usually prescribed vitamin D, especially in areas with little sun."
            },
            {
              "q": "How to store vitamins?",
              "a": "Vitamins are stored in a cool, dry, dark place, away from moisture and direct sunlight. Do not store in the bathroom due to humidity. Check the expiration date. Some vitamins (especially vitamin C) quickly lose activity if not stored properly."

            {
              "q": "Does smoking affect the need for vitamins?",
              "a": "Yes, smoking increases vitamin C requirements by 30-50 mg per day due to increased oxidative stress. Smokers also need more vitamin E and other antioxidants. The best solution is to quit smoking, but until this is done, it is important to increase your intake of antioxidants."
            },
            {
              "q": "How does stress affect vitamins?",
              "a": "Stress increases the need for B vitamins (especially B1, B5, B6, B12), vitamin C, and magnesium. Chronic stress depletes these vitamins. It is important to maintain their levels through nutrition and, if necessary, supplements."
            },
            {
              "q": "Is it possible to take vitamins on an empty stomach?",
              "a": "Water-soluble vitamins (B, C) can be taken on an empty stomach. Fat-soluble (A, D, E, K) are best taken with a meal containing fat for better absorption. If vitamins make you feel nauseous, take them with food. Follow the instructions on the package."
            },
            {
              "q": "How often should you check your vitamin levels?",
              "a": "If there are no symptoms of deficiency, testing can be done every 1-2 years. If there are symptoms or risk factors (vegetarianism, pregnancy, age 50+, chronic diseases) - on the recommendation of a doctor, usually once every 6-12 months. It is especially important to control vitamin D, B12, and iron."
            },
            {
              "q": "Is it possible to take expired vitamins?",
              "a": "It is not recommended to take expired vitamins. Over time, they lose potency and may be less effective. B vitamins and vitamin C lose their activity especially quickly. Use vitamins before the expiration date."

            },
            {
              "q": "Does alcohol affect vitamins?",
              "a": "Yes, alcohol disrupts the absorption and increases the consumption of vitamins: B vitamins (especially B1, B6, folic acid), vitamin C, magnesium. Regular alcohol consumption increases the risk of deficiency. It is recommended to increase your intake of these vitamins or take supplements."
            },
            {
              "q": "How do vitamins interact with each other?",
              "a": "Vitamins interact: vitamin C improves the absorption of iron, vitamin D improves calcium, vitamin E works synergistically with vitamin C, B vitamins work together. However, some vitamins may compete (for example, excess zinc reduces copper absorption). Balance is important."

            {
              "q": "How is dosage calculated by weight?",
              "a": "Dosage is calculated by multiplying body weight (in kg) by dosage per kilogram of weight (mg/kg), then multiplying the result by the number of doses per day. Formula: Single dose = Body weight × Dosage per kg; Daily dose = Single dose × Number of doses."
            },
            {
              "q": "Can it be used for children?",
              "a": "Yes, the calculator can be used by children, but with caution. For children, it is especially important to use special children's dosages indicated in the instructions for the drug, and be sure to consult with a pediatrician. Children's bodies are more sensitive to medications, and the wrong dosage can be dangerous."
            },
            {
              "q": "What to do if the dose is exceeded?",
              "a": "If the calculated dose exceeds the maximum daily dose indicated in the calculator, do not take the medicine under any circumstances without consulting a doctor. Be sure to consult a specialist to adjust your treatment regimen. Exceeding the maximum dose is dangerous to health."
            },
            {
              "q": "How accurate are the calculator's calculations?",
              "a": "The calculator performs accurate mathematical calculations based on the entered data. However, the result depends on the accuracy of the entered data (body weight, dosage per kg). The calculator does not take into account individual characteristics of the body, liver disease, kidney disease and other factors. Always consult your doctor."
            },
            {
              "q": "Can I use a calculator instead of consulting a doctor?",
              "a": "No! The calculator is for informational purposes only and does not replace medical advice. Only a doctor can take into account all factors (health status, other medications, contraindications) and prescribe the correct dosage. Self-medication is dangerous to health."
            },
            {
              "q": "How to correctly measure body weight for calculation?",
              "a": "Body weight should be measured on an accurate scale, without clothing or in minimal light clothing, in the morning on an empty stomach. Weigh yourself at the same time of day for accuracy. For an accurate calculation, use the current weight, not the old one."
            },
            {
              "q": "What is the difference between a single and daily dose?",
              "a": "A single dose is the amount of medicine to take at one time. The daily dose is the total amount of medicine that needs to be taken for the whole day (the sum of all single doses). For example, if a single dose is 500 mg and taken 3 times a day, then the daily dose = 500 × 3 = 1500 mg."
            },
            {
              "q": "What is the dosage per kilogram?",
              "a": "Dosage per kilogram (mg/kg) is the number of milligrams of medication needed per kilogram of body weight. For example, a dosage of 20 mg/kg means that for every kilogram of weight you need 20 mg of the drug. For a 70 kg person this would be 70 x 20 = 1400 mg."
            },
            {
              "q": "How to convert pounds to kilograms?",
              "a": "1 lb = 0.453592 kg (approximately 0.454 kg). To translate: Weight in kg = Weight in pounds × 0.454. For example, 150 pounds = 150 × 0.454 = 68.1 kg. The calculator has a function for switching units of measurement."
            },
            {
              "q": "Can it be used for older people?",
              "a": "Yes, you can use it, but with special attention. Older adults often have decreased kidney and liver function, which affects drug elimination. Dosages may require adjustment. Be sure to consult a doctor who will take into account your age and health status."
            },
            {
              "q": "What if I missed a medication dose?",
              "a": "If one dose is missed, do not usually take a double dose to make up for the missed dose. Continue taking as usual. If you have missed many doses or are unsure, consult your doctor. Do not increase the dose on your own."
            },
            {
              "q": "How often can I use the calculator?",
              "a": "The calculator can be used as often as needed to check the dosages of different medications. However, remember that the dosage should be prescribed by a doctor and the calculator is for checking and understanding only. Do not change the dosage yourself based on calculations."
            },
            {
              "q": "Does the calculator take into account interactions with other medications?",
              "a": "No, the calculator does not take into account interactions with other medications you take. Interactions may affect the effectiveness and safety of dosage. Only a doctor can take into account all the medications you are taking and prescribe a safe dosage."
            },
            {
              "q": "Can it be used for pregnant and lactating women?",
              "a": "For pregnant and breastfeeding women, dosages are often different and require special attention. Many medications are contraindicated during pregnancy and lactation. Be sure to consult with your doctor, who will take these factors into account and prescribe a safe dosage or alternative treatment."
            },
            {
              "q": "What to do if the dosage per kg is not indicated in the instructions?",
              "a": "If the dosage per kg is not indicated, then the drug has a fixed dosage that does not depend on weight. In this case, the calculator is not suitable. Use the dosage indicated in the instructions or prescribed by your doctor. Not all medications are dosed by weight."
            },
            {
              "q": "How is kidney function taken into account in the calculation?",
              "a": "The calculator does not take into account kidney function. In case of kidney disease, the dosage of many medications must be reduced, since they are eliminated by the kidneys more slowly. If you have kidney problems, be sure to consult your doctor to adjust the dosage."
            },
            {
              "q": "How is liver function taken into account in the calculation?",
              "a": "The calculator does not take liver function into account. In case of liver diseases, the metabolism of drugs is impaired, and dosages require adjustment. For liver diseases, the doctor should adjust the dosage taking into account the condition of the liver."
            },
            {
              "q": "Can it be used on animals?",
              "a": "The calculator is designed for people. For animals, dosages may vary significantly. Do not use a calculator to calculate dosages for animals - contact a veterinarian who knows the specifics of dosing drugs for animals."
            },
            {
              "q": "What is the maximum daily dose?",
              "a": "The maximum daily dose is the maximum allowable amount of medication that can be taken per day without risk to health. Exceeding this dose is dangerous and can lead to overdose and side effects. The calculator warns if the maximum dose is exceeded."
            },
            {
              "q": "How to take age into account when calculating dosage?",
              "a": "The calculator takes into account body weight, but not age directly. However, in children and older adults, body weight often correlates with age, and weight calculations indirectly account for these differences. For exact dosage, age must be taken into account by the doctor separately."
            },
            {
              "q": "Can I split the tablet if the calculated dose is less?",
              "a": "Not all tablets can be divided - it depends on the form of release. Coated tablets, capsules, and modified-release tablets usually cannot be split. If you need a lower dose, ask your doctor or pharmacist to see if there is a drug with the right dosage or a dosage form for dividing."
            },
            {
              "q": "How to recalculate the dosage when changing weight?",
              "a": "If the weight changes, the dosage must be recalculated: enter the new weight into the calculator with the same dosage parameters. If you lose or gain weight, especially during long-term treatment, consult your doctor to recalculate your dosage based on your new weight."
            },
            {
              "q": "Does the calculator take into account individual tolerance?",
              "a": "No, the calculator does not take into account individual tolerance to the drug, allergic reactions, concomitant diseases, or genetic characteristics of metabolism. Only a doctor can take all these factors into account and prescribe a safe and effective dosage."
            },
            {
              "q": "Can the calculator be used for all types of medications?",
              "a": "The calculator is only suitable for drugs dosed by body weight (mg/kg). Many medications have a fixed dosage that is not weight dependent. Also, some drugs require special calculation methods (for example, chemotherapy). Use the calculator only for drugs with dosage per kg."
            },
            {
              "q": "How does the reception frequency affect the calculation?",
              "a": "Dosing frequency determines how many times a day you need to take the medicine. It affects the daily dose: the more often you take it, the higher the daily dose. For example, with a single dose of 500 mg: 1 time per day = 500 mg/day, 2 times = 1000 mg/day, 3 times = 1500 mg/day."
            },
            {
              "q": "What to do if the calculated dose does not correspond to the available release form?",
              "a": "If the calculated dose does not match the available dosage forms (for example, you need 375 mg, but the tablets are only 250 or 500 mg), do not try to adjust the dosage yourself. Contact your doctor - he will select the appropriate form or adjust the dosage regimen."
            },
            {
              "q": "Can the calculator be used for prophylactic doses?",
              "a": "Yes, the calculator can be used to calculate prophylactic doses if they are indicated in mg/kg. However, preventive doses often differ from therapeutic ones and should be prescribed by a doctor, taking into account individual risk factors and health status."
            },
            {
              "q": "How to account for digestive disorders?",
              "a": "The calculator does not take into account digestive disorders that may affect the absorption of medications. If there are problems with the gastrointestinal tract (ulcers, inflammation, surgery), absorption may be impaired and the dosage requires adjustment. Discuss this with your doctor."
            },
            {
              "q": "Can I use the calculator for IV drugs?",
              "a": "The calculator can calculate the dosage, but intravenous medications require special care and professional administration. Never administer intravenous medications yourself. Injections must be performed by medical personnel, even if you know the dosage."
            },
            {
              "q": "What if the instructions contradict the calculation?",
              "a": "Always follow the instructions for the drug and the doctor's prescription. If the calculator's calculations contradict the instructions or doctor's prescription, use official data. The calculator is an auxiliary tool and does not replace medical advice."
