						{
							"q": "How to calculate car depreciation?",
							"a": "Use base rates by years and adjustments for mileage and segment. Calculator supports linear and exponential methods."
						},
						{
							"q": "What is car residual value?",
							"a": "This is estimated current market price of car accounting for age, mileage and class."
						},
						{
							"q": "How does mileage affect depreciation?",
							"a": "Excess mileage relative to 15,000 km/year accelerates depreciation by 5–10% per year."
						},
						{
							"q": "What depreciation methods are supported?",
							"a": "Linear (uniform decline) and exponential (more at start, less later)."
						},
						{
							"q": "What is average annual value loss?",
							"a": "Usually 10–15% per year after first years, when decline is higher (up to 18%)."
						},
						{
							"q": "How much does new car lose in first year?",
							"a": "On average about 18% of price, depends on brand and segment."
						},
						{
							"q": "How do premium cars depreciate?",
							"a": "Faster than average market: add ~5% to base decline rates."
						},
						{
							"q": "Do economy class lose less?",
							"a": "Yes, typically decline is slightly softer: −2% from base rates."
						},
						{
							"q": "How does brand affect liquidity?",
							"a": "Strong brands maintain price better: lower decline and faster sale."
						},
						{
							"q": "What is depreciation schedule?",
							"a": "This is visualization of car price decline by years."
						},
						{
							"q": "Can repairs and accidents be accounted for?",
							"a": "Yes, significant accidents and repaints reduce price in addition to base rates."
						},
						{
							"q": "What mileage is considered normal?",
							"a": "Benchmark — ~15,000 km/year. Strong deviations accelerate decline."
						},
						{
							"q": "What is car depreciation?",
							"a": "This is market value decline over time due to wear and market factors."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate current value?",
							"a": "Apply decline rates by years and adjustments to purchase price."
						},
						{
							"q": "How accurate are calculations?",
							"a": "These are approximate market estimates, accuracy depends on specific car."
						},
						{
							"q": "Is trim level accounted for?",
							"a": "Indirectly through segment/brand. Excessive trim often loses faster."
						},
						{
							"q": "Which method to choose?",
							"a": "For new car exponential is more realistic, for older years — linear."
						},
						{
							"q": "What is average annual depreciation?",
							"a": "Average share of price decline per year on selected interval."
						},
						{
							"q": "How does seasonality affect?",
							"a": "SUVs in winter and convertibles in summer behave differently, this affects price."
						},
						{
							"q": "What does liquidity depend on?",
							"a": "On brand, history, condition, trim and color. Good history increases price."
						},
						{
							"q": "What is residual price after 3 years?",
							"a": "Value estimate at typical 35–45% decline over three years."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to account for high mileage?",
							"a": "Add 5–10% to decline for each ~10–15k km above norm annually."
						},
						{
							"q": "Does dealer service help?",
							"a": "Yes, confirmed service history increases residual value."
						},
						{
							"q": "Does number of owners matter?",
							"a": "Yes, many owners usually reduces price and slows sale."
						},
						{
							"q": "How do facelifts and generations affect?",
							"a": "New generation launch accelerates decline of old model range."
						},
						{
							"q": "Can several cars be compared?",
							"a": "Yes, use same parameters and compare final values."
						},
						{
							"q": "Is there a lower price limit?",
							"a": "Yes, old cars tend toward market minimum for parts/export."
						},
						{
							"q": "Why does premium lose faster?",
							"a": "High price base, expensive service and narrow demand accelerate depreciation."
						},
						{
							"q": "What calculation horizon is best?",
							"a": "Usually 3–5 years is sufficient for purchase/sale planning."
						},
						{
							"q": "Can calculation be exported?",
							"a": "Save results as PDF/screenshot for discussion and comparison."

					"title": "Frequently Asked Questions About Ownership Cost Calculator",
					"faqItems": [
						{
							"q": "How to calculate car ownership cost?",
							"a": "Ownership cost is calculated as sum of all expenses for period: purchase price + (annual expenses × number of years). Annual expenses include: fuel, insurance (OSAGO, CASCO), vehicle tax, maintenance and repairs, depreciation. Our calculator automatically performs all calculations."
						},
						{
							"q": "What is included in car ownership cost?",
							"a": "Ownership cost includes: Car purchase (initial cost), Fuel (depends on mileage and consumption), Insurance (OSAGO mandatory, CASCO optional), Vehicle tax (depends on power), Maintenance & Repairs (regular servicing), Depreciation (value loss over time). All these expenses need to be accounted for real ownership cost estimation."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate fuel expenses?",
							"a": "Fuel expenses are calculated: Fuel per year = (Annual Mileage / 100) × Consumption (L/100km) × Price per liter. Example: mileage 20,000 km/year, consumption 10 L/100km, price $0.55/L: Fuel = (20,000 / 100) × 10 × 0.55 = $1,100/year. Over 5 years: $1,100 × 5 = $5,500."
						},
						{
							"q": "What is car depreciation?",
							"a": "Depreciation is car value loss over time due to wear, aging and obsolescence. Usually 10-18% of value per year. New cars lose more in first years (up to 20-25%), then depreciation slows. Depreciation is one of largest expense items in car ownership."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate cost per 1 km of car ownership?",
							"a": "Cost per 1 km is calculated: Cost per 1 km = Total Ownership Cost / (Annual Mileage × Ownership Period). Example: total cost $20,000 for 5 years, mileage 20,000 km/year: Cost per 1 km = $20,000 / (20,000 × 5) = $0.20/km. This indicator helps compare different cars."
						},
						{
							"q": "Which expenses have greatest impact on ownership cost?",
							"a": "Greatest impact on ownership cost: Depreciation (40-50% of total expenses), Fuel (20-30% of total expenses), Maintenance & Repairs (10-20% of total expenses), Insurance (5-15% of total expenses), Taxes (2-5% of total expenses). Depreciation usually constitutes largest share, especially in first years."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to reduce car ownership cost?",
							"a": "Ways to reduce ownership cost: Choose economical models (low fuel consumption), Regular maintenance (prevents expensive breakdowns), Compare insurance (choose optimal option), Buy cars with low depreciation (Japanese and German brands), Economical driving (reduces fuel consumption), Long ownership period (reduces cost per 1 km)."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate annual ownership cost?",
							"a": "Annual ownership cost = Fuel per year + Insurance per year + Taxes per year + Maintenance & Repairs per year + Depreciation per year. Example: fuel $1,000, insurance $150, taxes $30, maintenance $250, depreciation $1,200: Annual cost = $1,000 + $150 + $30 + $250 + $1,200 = $2,630/year."
						},
						{
							"q": "Does ownership period affect cost per 1 km?",
							"a": "Yes, ownership period directly affects cost per 1 km. With short period (1-3 years) depreciation is higher, which increases cost per 1 km. With long period (5-10 years) cost per 1 km decreases as depreciation is distributed over greater mileage. Optimal ownership period to minimize cost per 1 km is 5-7 years."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate ownership cost without CASCO?",
							"a": "When calculating without CASCO simply don't include CASCO cost in annual expenses. Example: fuel $1,000, OSAGO $50, taxes $30, maintenance $250, depreciation $1,200 (without CASCO): Annual cost = $1,000 + $50 + $30 + $250 + $1,200 = $2,530/year. Savings: ~$100-$300/year."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate ownership cost for diesel car?",
							"a": "For diesel car calculation is similar, but account for: Low consumption (usually 20-30% lower than gasoline), High diesel price (usually $0.03-$0.05/L higher), More expensive maintenance (diesel engines require more attention), Slower depreciation (diesels hold value better). Example: consumption 6 L/100km instead of 10 L/100km saves ~40% on fuel."
						},
						{
							"q": "What is TCO (Total Cost of Ownership)?",
							"a": "TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) is full ownership cost including all expenses for purchase, operation and maintenance for entire ownership period. TCO includes: purchase cost, fuel, insurance, taxes, maintenance and repairs, depreciation, additional expenses. TCO helps realistically estimate how much car really costs."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate ownership cost for new car?",
							"a": "For new car account for: High depreciation in first years (20-25%/year), Warranty service (usually first 3 years cheaper), High insurance cost (CASCO mandatory), Low repair expenses (first years). Example: new car $20,000, depreciation 20%/year = $4,000/year just for depreciation."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate ownership cost for used car?",
							"a": "For used car account for: Low depreciation (5-10%/year), High repair expenses (wear increases), Possibility without CASCO (not always mandatory), High maintenance expenses (requires more attention). Example: used car $5,000, depreciation 8%/year = $400/year, but repairs may cost $500+/year."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to compare ownership cost of different cars?",
							"a": "For comparison calculate ownership cost for each car for same period (e.g., 5 years) and compare: Total ownership cost, Cost per 1 km, Annual expenses, Share of each expense type. Car with lower cost per 1 km at same mileage is more economical. Also consider comfort, reliability and personal preferences."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate ownership cost for electric car?",
							"a": "For electric car calculation differs: Energy consumption (kWh/100km) instead of fuel consumption, Charging cost (depends on electricity tariff), Low maintenance expenses (fewer parts), High depreciation in first years, Vehicle tax benefits. Example: consumption 20 kWh/100km, tariff $0.05/kWh: 20,000 km/year = 4,000 kWh × $0.05 = $200/year for charging (vs $1,100 for gasoline)."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate ownership cost accounting for sale?",
							"a": "When calculating accounting for sale: Calculate residual value through depreciation, Subtract residual value from total ownership cost. Example: car $10,000, depreciation 12%/year, period 5 years: Residual value = $10,000 × (1 - 0.12)^5 = $5,277. Real ownership cost = Total Cost - Residual Value. This is more accurate indicator."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate ownership cost for hybrid car?",
							"a": "For hybrid car account for: Low fuel consumption (usually 4-6 L/100km), High purchase cost (more expensive than regular by $2,000-$5,000), High depreciation in first years, Low maintenance expenses (hybrid systems are reliable), Possible tax benefits. Hybrids are more profitable at high mileage (over 30,000 km/year) due to fuel savings."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate ownership cost for car with LPG?",
							"a": "For car with LPG account for: LPG installation cost ($500-$1,000), Gas consumption (usually 10-20% higher than gasoline), Low gas price (2 times cheaper than gasoline), Additional LPG maintenance expenses ($50-$100/year), Payback in 1-2 years at mileage over 20,000 km/year. Example: fuel savings $500/year pays back LPG installation in 1-2 years."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate ownership cost accounting for loan or leasing?",
							"a": "When calculating accounting for loan/leasing add: Loan interest (overpayment 10-30%), CASCO cost (usually mandatory), Down payment, Buyout cost (for leasing). Example: loan $15,000 for 5 years at 12%: overpayment ~$4,000. Loan/leasing increases ownership cost by 10-30%. Leasing may be more profitable for business due to tax benefits."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate ownership cost for premium class car?",
							"a": "For premium class account for: High purchase cost, High insurance cost (CASCO mandatory, expensive), High maintenance cost (official service expensive), High depreciation (premium loses value faster), Additional expenses (tires, accessories more expensive). Premium cars have cost per 1 km $0.40-$0.70 due to high expenses on all items."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate ownership cost for mid-range class car?",
							"a": "For mid-range class typical indicators: Purchase cost: $10,000-$20,000, Annual expenses: $2,500-$4,000, Cost per 1 km: $0.25-$0.35. Mid-range class is optimal for comfort and ownership cost ratio. Mid-range cars have balanced expenses across all items."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate ownership cost for economy class?",
							"a": "For economy class typical indicators: Purchase cost: $6,000-$10,000, Annual expenses: $1,500-$2,500, Cost per 1 km: $0.18-$0.25. Economy class has minimal expenses, but may require more maintenance attention. Optimal for urban use with low mileage."
						},
						{
							"q": "How does mileage affect ownership cost?",
							"a": "Mileage directly affects cost per 1 km: High mileage (30,000+ km/year): high fuel and maintenance expenses, high wear depreciation, cost per 1 km higher. Low mileage (up to 10,000 km/year): low fuel expenses, high share of fixed expenses (insurance, taxes), cost per 1 km lower due to depreciation distribution. Optimal mileage 15,000-25,000 km/year for expense balance."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate ownership cost for car without CASCO?",
							"a": "When calculating without CASCO savings are $200-$1,200/year depending on car cost. Risk: in accident repair at own expense. Example: car $15,000, CASCO $400/year: without CASCO savings $400/year, but in accident expenses may be $2,000+. Decision depends on risk and your readiness for repair at own expense."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate optimal ownership period to minimize cost per 1 km?",
							"a": "Optimal ownership period to minimize cost per 1 km usually is 5-7 years. With short period (1-3 years) high depreciation increases cost per 1 km. With long period (10+ years) repair expenses grow, which also increases cost. Period 5-7 years is optimal: depreciation has already decreased, but repair expenses are not yet critical."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate ownership cost for new vs used car?",
							"a": "Comparison of new and used: New car: high purchase cost, high depreciation, low repair expenses (warranty), high insurance cost. Used: low purchase cost, low depreciation, high repair expenses, low insurance cost. Usually used car has lower cost per 1 km at mileage over 15,000 km/year."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate ownership cost for cars of different brands?",
							"a": "Different brands have different ownership cost: Japanese (Toyota, Honda): low depreciation, reliability, cost per 1 km $0.18-$0.25. German (BMW, Mercedes): high maintenance cost, high depreciation in first years, cost per 1 km $0.40-$0.60. Korean (Hyundai, Kia): average ownership cost, cost per 1 km $0.25-$0.35. Domestic (Lada): low purchase cost, average expenses, cost per 1 km $0.20-$0.30."
						},
						{
							"q": "How does region affect ownership cost?",
							"a": "Region significantly affects ownership cost: Moscow/SPb: high parking expenses ($600-$1,200/year), high parking fines, high vehicle tax, high service prices. Regions: low parking expenses, low fines, low vehicle tax, low service prices. Difference in ownership cost between Moscow and regions can be $500-$1,000/year. Driving style also affects: aggressive driving increases expenses by 15-25%."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate ownership cost for car accounting for sale at end of period?",
							"a": "When calculating accounting for sale: Calculate residual value through depreciation, Subtract sale cost from total ownership cost, Get real expenses. Example: car $10,000, depreciation 12%/year, period 5 years, residual value $5,277. If sold for $5,000: real expenses = Total Cost - $5,000. This is more accurate ownership cost indicator. Different car types (sedan, crossover, SUV) have different cost per 1 km: from $0.25 to $0.60."

					"faqItems": [
						{
							"q": "How to calculate OSAGO cost?",
							"a": "OSAGO cost is calculated by formula: Base Rate × KT × KBM × KVS × KM × KO. Base rate is $50. Use our calculator by entering region, engine power, driver age and experience, number of drivers and bonus-malus coefficient."
						},
						{
							"q": "Which coefficients affect OSAGO cost?",
							"a": "5 coefficients affect OSAGO cost: KT (territory) — from 1.0 to 2.0, KBM (bonus-malus) — from 0.5 to 2.45, KVS (age-experience) — 1.0 or 1.8, KM (power) — from 0.6 to 1.4, KO (driver restriction) — from 1.0 to 1.8. Each coefficient can significantly change final cost."
						},
						{
							"q": "What is bonus-malus coefficient (KBM)?",
							"a": "KBM is coefficient that depends on driver's driving history. With accident-free driving KBM decreases from 1.0 to 0.5 (maximum 50% discount). With accidents KBM increases to 2.45 (145% surcharge). KBM is preserved when changing insurance company."
						},
						{
							"q": "What is territorial coefficient (KT) in Moscow and SPb?",
							"a": "In Moscow KT = 2.0 (highest), in Saint Petersburg KT = 1.8, in other regions KT = 1.0. Territorial coefficient reflects accident statistics in region and affects OSAGO cost."
						},
						{
							"q": "How do age and experience affect OSAGO cost?",
							"a": "KVS coefficient = 1.8 for drivers under 22 years with experience less than 3 years, otherwise KVS = 1.0. Young inexperienced drivers pay 80% more for OSAGO. Experience is counted from moment of obtaining first driver's license."
						},
						{
							"q": "How does engine power affect OSAGO cost?",
							"a": "KM coefficient depends on power: up to 70 hp = 0.6, 70-100 hp = 1.0, 101-120 hp = 1.1, 121-150 hp = 1.2, over 150 hp = 1.4. More powerful car means higher OSAGO cost."
						},
						{
							"q": "What's better: one driver or unlimited list?",
							"a": "One driver (KO = 1.0) is cheapest option. Several drivers (KO = 1.2) increases cost by 20%. Unlimited list (KO = 1.8) increases cost by 80%. Choose minimum list if possible."
						},
						{
							"q": "Can KBM be changed when switching insurance company?",
							"a": "No, KBM is tied to driver and preserved when switching insurance company. KBM data is stored in unified RSA (Russian Union of Auto Insurers) database and available to all insurance companies."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to find out current KBM?",
							"a": "KBM can be found on RSA website by entering driver and car data. Also KBM is indicated in previous OSAGO policy. When first applying for OSAGO KBM = 1.0 (base rate)."
						},
						{
							"q": "What to do if KBM is calculated incorrectly?",
							"a": "If KBM is calculated incorrectly, contact insurance company with application for recalculation. If necessary file complaint to RSA or Central Bank of Russia. Incorrect KBM can lead to overpayment or underpayment for OSAGO."
						},
						{
							"q": "Is OSAGO mandatory?",
							"a": "Yes, OSAGO is mandatory for all car owners in Russia. Driving without valid OSAGO policy incurs $8 fine and prohibition to operate vehicle until policy is issued."
						},
						{
							"q": "When to renew OSAGO?",
							"a": "OSAGO is issued for 1 year and renewed annually. It's recommended to renew 1-2 months before expiration to preserve current KBM and avoid cost increase."
						},
						{
							"q": "Can OSAGO be issued online?",
							"a": "Yes, most insurance companies offer online OSAGO issuance. It's convenient, fast and often cheaper than in office. For issuance need document scans and digital signature."
						},
						{
							"q": "What documents are needed for OSAGO?",
							"a": "For OSAGO need: driver passport, driver's license, PTS or STS of car, diagnostic card (if required), previous OSAGO policy (to determine KBM). For legal entities additionally need founding documents."
						},
						{
							"q": "What is diagnostic card and is it needed?",
							"a": "Diagnostic card is document about passing technical inspection. It's needed for cars older than 4 years. Without valid diagnostic card cannot issue OSAGO. Card validity is 1 year for new cars, 6 months for old ones."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to save on OSAGO?",
							"a": "Ways to save: 1) Maintain good KBM through accident-free driving. 2) Limit driver list. 3) Choose car with lower power. 4) Compare offers from different insurance companies. 5) Renew policy in advance."
						},

						},
						{
							"q": "What is deductible for OSAGO?",
							"a": "Deductible is part of damage that insurer covers themselves. For OSAGO deductible is not applied — insurer covers all damage within limit. Deductible can only apply for CASCO."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to verify OSAGO policy authenticity?",
							"a": "Policy authenticity can be checked on RSA website by entering policy series and number. Also can check through insurance company mobile app or by contacting insurer office. Fake policies are invalid and incur fines."

							"a": "In 2024 OSAGO base rate is $50 (unchanged from 2023). Some territorial coefficients and KBM calculation rules changed. It's recommended to recalculate OSAGO cost accounting for new tariffs."
						},
						{
							"q": "Can OSAGO be issued without technical inspection?",
							"a": "No, for OSAGO need valid diagnostic card (technical inspection). Exception — cars younger than 4 years, for which technical inspection is not required. Without technical inspection OSAGO policy is invalid."
						},
						{
							"q": "What to do if lost OSAGO policy?",
							"a": "If lost OSAGO policy, contact insurance company for duplicate. Duplicate is issued free of charge upon passport presentation. Until receiving duplicate can drive car having insurance documents with you."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate OSAGO for taxi?",

					"title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
					"faqItems": [
						{
							"q": "How to calculate CASCO cost?",
							"a": "CASCO cost is calculated by formula: (Car Value × 6%) × Kregion × Kage × Kexperience × Kalarm × Kdeductible. Use our calculator by entering car value, year of manufacture, driver age and experience, region, alarm system presence and deductible amount."
						},
						{
							"q": "Which coefficients affect CASCO cost?",
							"a": "5 coefficients affect CASCO cost: Kregion (1.0-1.2) — depends on region, Kage (1.0-1.5) — depends on driver age, Kexperience (1.0-1.3) — depends on driving experience, Kalarm (0.9-1.0) — depends on alarm presence, Kdeductible (0.8-1.0) — depends on deductible amount."
						},
						{
							"q": "What is deductible for CASCO?",
							"a": "Deductible is part of damage that insurer covers themselves when insurance event occurs. $100 deductible means that for damage up to $100 you pay yourself, above — insurance company pays. Deductible reduces CASCO cost by 10-20%."
						},
						{
							"q": "What is regional coefficient in Moscow and SPb?",
							"a": "In Moscow Kregion = 1.2 (highest), in Saint Petersburg Kregion = 1.1, in other regions Kregion = 1.0. Regional coefficient reflects accident and theft statistics in region."
						},
						{
							"q": "How does driver age affect CASCO cost?",
							"a": "Kage coefficient: under 22 years = 1.5, 22-30 years = 1.2, over 30 years = 1.0. Young drivers are considered more risky and pay more for CASCO."
						},
						{
							"q": "How does driving experience affect CASCO cost?",
							"a": "Kexperience coefficient: under 3 years = 1.3, 3-10 years = 1.1, over 10 years = 1.0. Inexperienced drivers get into accidents more often, so they pay more for insurance."
						},
						{
							"q": "How does alarm affect CASCO cost?",
							"a": "Anti-theft system presence reduces CASCO cost by 10% (Kalarm = 0.9). Alarm protects car from theft and robbery, so insurance companies provide discount. Without alarm Kalarm = 1.0."
						},
						{
							"q": "What's better: CASCO or OSAGO?",
							"a": "CASCO and OSAGO are different types of insurance. OSAGO is mandatory and covers damage to third parties. CASCO is voluntary and covers damage to your car. CASCO is 5-10 times more expensive than OSAGO, but provides full car protection."
						},
						{
							"q": "Can CASCO be issued without OSAGO?",
							"a": "No, for CASCO need valid OSAGO policy. OSAGO is mandatory insurance, without it cannot drive car. CASCO is additional protection issued on top of OSAGO."
						},
						{
							"q": "What risks does CASCO cover?",
							"a": "CASCO covers: accidents, car theft, robbery, natural disasters (hurricane, flood, hail), unlawful actions of third parties (vandalism, arson), objects falling on car. Full list of risks is indicated in insurance contract."
						},
						{
							"q": "Is CASCO mandatory?",
							"a": "No, CASCO is voluntary insurance. Unlike OSAGO, CASCO is not mandatory. However CASCO is recommended for expensive cars, as it provides full protection from all risks and can save significant amounts when insurance event occurs."
						},
						{
							"q": "When to renew CASCO?",
							"a": "CASCO is issued for 1 year and renewed annually. It's recommended to renew 1-2 months before expiration to avoid gap in insurance coverage. When gap in insurance occurs coefficients may change."
						},
						{
							"q": "Can CASCO be issued online?",
							"a": "Yes, most insurance companies offer online CASCO issuance. It's convenient, fast and often cheaper than in office. For issuance need document scans, car photos and digital signature."
						},
						{
							"q": "What documents are needed for CASCO?",
							"a": "For CASCO need: driver passport, driver's license, PTS or STS of car, diagnostic card, OSAGO policy, car value certificate (for expensive cars), car photos. For legal entities additionally need founding documents."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to save on CASCO?",
							"a": "Ways to save: 1) Install alarm — 10% discount. 2) Choose deductible — 10-20% discount. 3) Compare offers from different insurance companies. 4) Renew policy in advance. 5) Choose car with lower value. 6) Increase driving experience."
						},
						{
							"q": "What to do in accident with CASCO?",
							"a": "In accident with CASCO: 1) Call traffic police and ambulance (if there are casualties). 2) Record accident circumstances. 3) Contact insurance company within 5 days. 4) Provide all necessary documents. 5) Receive damage compensation or repair referral."
						},
						{
							"q": "What is CASCO payout limit?",
							"a": "CASCO payout limit equals car value at moment of insurance. In case of total loss full value is paid. For partial damage — repair cost. Limit may be limited by car wear (usually no more than 80% of value)."
						},
						{
							"q": "Can CASCO be returned when selling car?",
							"a": "Yes, can return part of CASCO cost when early terminating contract. Refund is calculated proportionally to unused period. Contact insurance company with application and documents about car deregistration."
						},
						{
							"q": "What is wear for CASCO?",
							"a": "Wear is car value reduction due to operation. When calculating CASCO payout wear is accounted for: for cars up to 2 years — 0%, 2-5 years — 5% per year, 5-10 years — 10% per year, over 10 years — 15% per year. Wear cannot exceed 80% of value."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to verify CASCO policy authenticity?",
							"a": "Policy authenticity can be checked on insurance company website by entering policy series and number. Also can check through insurer mobile app or by contacting office. Fake policies are invalid and incur fines."

						},
						{
							"q": "Can CASCO be issued for car without PTS?",
							"a": "No, for CASCO need PTS (vehicle passport) or STS (registration certificate). Without these documents CASCO policy is not issued. PTS must be original, not copy."
						},
						{
							"q": "What is CASCO+ and how differs from regular?",
							"a": "CASCO+ is extended CASCO version with additional services: towing, replacement car, legal assistance, 24/7 support. CASCO+ cost is 20-30% higher than regular, but includes more services."
						},
						{
							"q": "What to do if insurance company refuses payout?",
							"a": "If payout refused: 1) Get written refusal with justification. 2) Contact RSA with complaint. 3) File lawsuit in court. 4) Contact Central Bank of Russia. 5) Engage independent expert for damage assessment."

					"title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
					"faqItems": [
						{
							"q": "How to calculate fuel consumption?",
							"a": "Fuel consumption is calculated as follows: fill full tank, reset odometer, drive 100-200 km, fill full tank again and divide fill volume by distance traveled, then multiply by 100. Formula: Consumption (L/100km) = (Fill Volume (L) / Mileage (km)) × 100. Example: filled 15 L, drove 200 km: Consumption = (15 / 200) × 100 = 7.5 L/100km."
						},
						{
							"q": "How far can drive on 10 liters of gasoline?",
							"a": "Depends on car consumption. Formula: Distance = (Fuel Quantity / Consumption) × 100. Examples: At consumption 7 L/100km: (10 / 7) × 100 = 143 km. At consumption 10 L/100km: (10 / 10) × 100 = 100 km. At consumption 12 L/100km: (10 / 12) × 100 = 83 km. Lower consumption means more distance on same fuel volume."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate how many liters of fuel needed for trip?",
							"a": "Use formula: Fuel (L) = (Consumption (L/100km) × Distance (km)) / 100. Example: consumption 9 L/100km, trip 500 km: Fuel = (9 × 500) / 100 = 45 L. It's recommended to take 10-15% reserve for unforeseen situations. For trip of 500 km better plan 50 L of fuel."
						},
						{
							"q": "What is normal fuel consumption for car?",
							"a": "Normal consumption depends on car type and class: Small cars (1.0-1.6 L): 6-8 L/100km in city, 5-7 L/100km on highway. Mid-range class (1.6-2.5 L): 8-11 L/100km in city, 7-9 L/100km on highway. Crossovers (2.0-3.0 L): 10-13 L/100km in city, 8-11 L/100km on highway. SUVs (2.5-5.0 L): 12-18 L/100km in city, 10-15 L/100km on highway."
						},
						{
							"q": "Why did fuel consumption increase?",
							"a": "Reasons for consumption increase: 1) Reduced tire pressure (increases consumption by 3-5%), 2) Dirty filters (air, fuel), 3) Sensor malfunction (oxygen sensor, flow meter), 4) Spark plug wear, 5) Cooling system problems, 6) Car overload, 7) Aggressive driving style, 8) Traffic jams and frequent stops, 9) Air conditioning use."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to reduce fuel consumption?",
							"a": "Ways to reduce consumption: 1) Maintain correct tire pressure (according to manufacturer instructions), 2) Use quality fuel of recommended brand, 3) Accelerate and brake smoothly, avoid sharp maneuvers, 4) Don't overload car — remove extra luggage, 5) Regularly pass maintenance (filter and spark plug replacement), 6) Plan routes avoiding traffic jams, 7) Use cruise control on highway, 8) Turn off air conditioning at low temperature, 9) Don't warm up engine long — 30-60 seconds is enough."
						},
						{
							"q": "What's the difference between city and highway consumption?",
							"a": "In city consumption is higher due to frequent stops, accelerations, traffic jams and low speed. On highway consumption is lower due to constant speed, rare stops and optimal conditions. Usually difference is 20-40%. Example: car with consumption 8 L/100km on highway will consume 10-11 L/100km in city. Mixed cycle (city + highway) usually is in between."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate fuel cost for trip?",
							"a": "First calculate fuel quantity: Fuel = (Consumption × Distance) / 100. Then multiply by price per liter: Cost = Fuel × Price per liter. Example: consumption 9 L/100km, trip 600 km, price $0.55/L: Fuel = (9 × 600) / 100 = 54 L, Cost = 54 × 0.55 = $29.70. Add 10-15% reserve for reliability: $29.70 × 1.1 = $32.67."
						},
						{
							"q": "What is mixed cycle fuel consumption?",
							"a": "Mixed cycle is average fuel consumption at combination of city and highway driving (usually 60% city, 40% highway). Manufacturers indicate consumption in three modes: city (WLTP city), highway (WLTP highway) and mixed (WLTP combined). Mixed cycle most accurately reflects real consumption for most drivers. Formula: Mixed = (City × 0.6) + (Highway × 0.4)."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to check real car fuel consumption?",
							"a": "Checking method: 1) Fill full tank until pump clicks, 2) Reset mileage counter or record current, 3) Drive 100-300 km in normal mode, 4) Fill full tank again until click, record fill volume and mileage, 5) Calculate: Consumption = (Fill Volume / Mileage) × 100. Repeat 2-3 times for accuracy. Average results. Keep journal to track changes."
						},
						{
							"q": "How many liters in full tank for different cars?",
							"a": "Fuel tank volume depends on car class: Small cars: 35-45 L (Renault Logan — 50 L, Lada Granta — 43 L). Mid-range class: 50-65 L (Toyota Camry — 60 L, Volkswagen Passat — 66 L). Crossovers: 55-70 L (Hyundai Creta — 50 L, Kia Sportage — 58 L, Toyota RAV4 — 60 L). SUVs: 70-100 L (Toyota Land Cruiser — 93 L, Nissan Patrol — 98 L). Vans: 75-100 L (Mercedes Sprinter — 75 L, Ford Transit — 80 L)."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate how many times need to refuel on trip?",
							"a": "Refueling calculation: 1) Calculate required fuel: Fuel = (Consumption × Distance) / 100, 2) Divide by tank volume: Refuelings = Fuel / Tank Volume, round up, 3) Add 10-15% reserve. Example: trip 1200 km, consumption 9 L/100km, tank 60 L: Fuel = (9 × 1200) / 100 = 108 L, Refuelings = 108 / 60 = 1.8 ≈ 2 times, With reserve = 3 refuelings. First refueling — full tank before trip, then refuelings every ~400-500 km."
						},
						{
							"q": "What fuel consumption is considered economical?",
							"a": "Economical consumption: Small cars: up to 7 L/100km. Mid-range class: up to 9 L/100km. Crossovers: up to 11 L/100km. SUVs: up to 15 L/100km. Diesel engines usually are 20-30% more economical than gasoline. Hybrid cars have consumption 4-6 L/100km (accounting for electric motor). Electric cars don't consume fuel, but have energy consumption in kWh/100km. Economy depends on driving style, operation conditions and technical state."
						},
						{
							"q": "Does fuel quality affect consumption?",
							"a": "Yes, fuel quality affects consumption and engine operation. Low quality fuel: Increases consumption by 3-8% due to incomplete combustion, Clogs fuel system, Reduces engine power, Increases breakdown risk. High quality fuel: Provides optimal combustion, Maintains system cleanliness, Gives declared power, Reduces malfunction risk. It's recommended to use fuel of manufacturer recommended octane number (AI-92, AI-95, AI-98) from trusted gas stations."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate fuel consumption per 1 km?",
							"a": "Consumption per 1 km is calculated: Consumption per 1 km (L) = Consumption per 100 km / 100. Example: consumption 8.5 L/100km: Consumption per 1 km = 8.5 / 100 = 0.085 L/km. This is convenient for calculating short trips. For trip of 20 km: Fuel = 0.085 × 20 = 1.7 L. Also can calculate cost per 1 km: Cost per 1 km = (Consumption per 1 km × Price per liter). At consumption 0.085 L/km and price $0.55/L: Cost = 0.085 × 0.55 = $0.047/km."
						},
						{
							"q": "What affects fuel consumption most?",
							"a": "Greatest impact on consumption: 1) Driving style (sharp acceleration and braking increases consumption by 20-40%), 2) Driving speed (optimal 80-90 km/h, over 120 km/h consumption sharply grows), 3) Tire pressure (reduced pressure increases consumption by 3-5%), 4) Car load (each 100 kg increases consumption by 0.5-1 L/100km), 5) Traffic jams and frequent stops (increases consumption by 30-50%), 6) Air conditioning use (increases consumption by 5-15%), 7) Technical state (dirty filters, spark plug wear increases consumption by 10-20%)."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate fuel consumption for truck?",
							"a": "Calculation for truck is similar to car, but consumption is significantly higher. Average truck consumption: Light trucks (up to 3.5 t): 10-15 L/100km. Medium trucks (3.5-7.5 t): 15-25 L/100km. Heavy trucks (7.5-20 t): 25-40 L/100km. Consumption depends on load: empty truck consumes less, loaded — more. Formula same: Fuel = (Consumption × Distance) / 100. For truck important to account for additional consumption when loaded: +10-30% depending on cargo weight."
						},
						{
							"q": "How far can drive on full tank?",
							"a": "Depends on tank volume and consumption. Formula: Distance = (Tank Volume / Consumption) × 100. Examples: Tank 45 L, consumption 7 L/100km: Distance = (45 / 7) × 100 = 643 km. Tank 60 L, consumption 9 L/100km: Distance = (60 / 9) × 100 = 667 km. Tank 70 L, consumption 12 L/100km: Distance = (70 / 12) × 100 = 583 km. Tank 93 L, consumption 15 L/100km: Distance = (93 / 15) × 100 = 620 km. It's recommended not to drop level below 1/4 tank to protect fuel pump."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate fuel consumption accounting for traffic jams?",
							"a": "In traffic jams consumption increases by 30-100% due to frequent stops and accelerations. To account for jams: 1) Calculate base city consumption, 2) Estimate time in jams (e.g., 30% of trip time), 3) Add jam coefficient: Consumption with jams = Base Consumption × (1 + Jam Coefficient). Coefficients: Light jams (30% time): +10-20%. Medium jams (50% time): +30-50%. Heavy jams (70% time): +50-100%. Example: base consumption 10 L/100km, medium jams: Consumption = 10 × 1.4 = 14 L/100km."
						},
						{
							"q": "What's the difference between gasoline and diesel consumption?",
							"a": "Diesel engines are 20-35% more economical than gasoline at same volume. Reasons: Diesel has higher energy density (more energy per liter), Diesel engines work on leaner mixture, Diesel has higher efficiency (up to 45% vs 30% for gasoline). Example: Gasoline engine 2.0 L: consumption 9-11 L/100km. Diesel 2.0 L: consumption 6-8 L/100km. Difference per 1000 km: Gasoline: 100 L, Diesel: 70 L. Savings: 30 L or ~$16.50 at price $0.55/L. However diesel fuel is usually more expensive than gasoline by $0.03-$0.05/L, which partially compensates savings."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate monthly fuel consumption?",
							"a": "Monthly consumption calculation: 1) Know average monthly mileage (e.g., 2000 km), 2) Know average consumption of your car (e.g., 9 L/100km), 3) Calculate: Monthly Consumption = (Mileage × Consumption) / 100. Example: mileage 2000 km, consumption 9 L/100km: Monthly Consumption = (2000 × 9) / 100 = 180 L. Monthly Cost = 180 × 0.55 = $99. For accurate calculation keep refueling and mileage journal, sum fill volumes per month."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate annual fuel consumption?",
							"a": "Annual consumption calculated similarly to monthly: Annual Consumption = (Annual Mileage × Consumption) / 100. Average annual mileage of passenger car: 15,000-20,000 km. Example: mileage 18,000 km/year, consumption 9 L/100km: Annual Consumption = (18,000 × 9) / 100 = 1,620 L. Annual Cost = 1,620 × 0.55 = $891. For accurate calculation: Record mileage at start of year, Record mileage at end of year, Calculate difference, Apply formula with your average consumption, Sum all refuelings per year."
						},
						{
							"q": "What is hybrid car fuel consumption?",
							"a": "Hybrid cars have consumption 4-6 L/100km thanks to combination of ICE and electric motor. Operation principle: At start and low speeds electric motor works (consumption = 0), At medium speeds ICE works with optimal efficiency, At acceleration both engines work together, At braking energy recuperates to battery. Hybrid consumption examples: Toyota Prius: 3.8-4.5 L/100km (WLTP mixed), Lexus ES 300h: 4.5-5.2 L/100km, Honda Insight: 4.2-5.0 L/100km. Consumption depends on usage mode: predominantly city — 4-5 L/100km, predominantly highway — 5-6 L/100km."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate fuel consumption for motorcycle?",
							"a": "Calculation for motorcycle is similar to car. Average motorcycle consumption: Mopeds and scooters (50-150 cc): 2-3 L/100km. Light motorcycles (150-400 cc): 3-5 L/100km. Medium motorcycles (400-750 cc): 4-7 L/100km. Sports motorcycles (750-1000+ cc): 6-10 L/100km. Cruisers (large): 7-12 L/100km. Formula: Fuel = (Consumption × Distance) / 100. Example: motorcycle with consumption 5 L/100km, trip 300 km: Fuel = (5 × 300) / 100 = 15 L. Motorcycle tank usually 12-20 L, on full tank can drive 240-400 km."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate fuel consumption with trailer?",
							"a": "Trailer increases consumption by 15-30% depending on weight and size. Calculation: Base consumption without trailer (e.g., 9 L/100km), Trailer coefficient: Light trailer (up to 500 kg): +15-20%, Medium trailer (500-1000 kg): +20-25%, Heavy trailer (1000+ kg): +25-30%. Consumption with trailer = Base Consumption × (1 + Coefficient). Example: base consumption 9 L/100km, medium trailer 700 kg: Consumption = 9 × 1.225 = 11.025 L/100km. For trip of 500 km: Fuel = (11.025 × 500) / 100 = 55.125 L (without trailer would be 45 L)."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to save fuel in traffic jams?",
							"a": "Ways to save in jams: 1) Don't warm up engine long — 30-60 seconds is enough, start driving smoothly immediately, 2) Accelerate and brake smoothly, avoid sharp maneuvers, 3) Maintain constant speed, use coasting (neutral on safe sections), 4) Turn off air conditioning at low temperature, 5) Close windows at high speed — open windows increase resistance, 6) Plan routes avoiding rush hours, 7) Use navigator with traffic information, 8) Don't overload car, 9) Monitor tire pressure."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate fuel consumption for LPG (gas equipment)?",
							"a": "LPG uses gas (propane-butane) instead of gasoline. Gas consumption usually 10-20% higher than gasoline due to lower energy density. Calculation: Gasoline consumption (e.g., 10 L/100km), Gas consumption = Gasoline × 1.15 = 11.5 L/100km, Cost: At gasoline price $0.55/L and gas $0.28/L: Gasoline: 10 × 0.55 = $5.50/100km, Gas: 11.5 × 0.28 = $3.22/100km. Savings: $5.50 - $3.22 = $2.28/100km (41% savings). Per 20,000 km/year: Savings = $456. Formula same: Fuel = (Consumption × Distance) / 100, but use gas consumption."
						},
						{
							"q": "Does season affect fuel consumption?",
							"a": "Yes, season affects consumption: Winter: Increase by 10-20% due to engine warming, heater use, tire pressure reduction from cold, slippery road (wheel spin). Summer: Increase by 5-15% due to air conditioning use, increased air temperature (less dense air), traffic jams from vacations. Spring/Fall: Optimal conditions, minimum consumption. Recommendation: When planning trips account for seasonal coefficients, adding 10-15% to calculation in winter and summer periods."

						{
							"q": "How to calculate fuel consumption when driving in mountains?",
							"a": "Mountain driving increases consumption by 20-50% due to climbs. Calculation: Base consumption (e.g., 9 L/100km), Mountain coefficient: Light climbs (slope up to 5%): +15-20%, Medium climbs (slope 5-10%): +25-35%, Steep climbs (slope 10%+): +40-50%. Mountain consumption = Base Consumption × (1 + Coefficient). Example: base consumption 9 L/100km, medium climbs: Consumption = 9 × 1.3 = 11.7 L/100km. At descent consumption can be minimal (coasting), but with frequent braking consumption increases. For mountainous terrain better calculate consumption separately for climbs and descents."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate fuel consumption for engine idling?",
							"a": "At idle engine consumes 0.5-2 L/hour depending on volume and engine type. Calculation: Hourly Consumption × Hours = Fuel Volume. Examples: Small car (1.4 L): 0.5-0.8 L/hour, Mid-range class (2.0 L): 0.8-1.2 L/hour, SUV (3.5 L): 1.5-2.0 L/hour. Example: SUV idling 2 hours: Consumption = 1.75 × 2 = 3.5 L. Per month idling in jams 30 minutes per day (15 hours): Consumption = 1.75 × 15 = 26.25 L. Cost = 26.25 × 0.55 = $14.44. Recommendation: At stops over 2 minutes better turn off engine for savings."

							"a": "Turbocharger increases power, but may increase consumption by 5-15% at aggressive driving due to greater fuel consumption. At calm driving consumption may be even less thanks to efficient combustion. Calculation uses real consumption of your turbocharged car. Formula: Fuel = (Consumption × Distance) / 100. Turbo engine consumption examples: 1.4 TSI (Volkswagen): 6-8 L/100km (economical driving), 2.0 TSI: 8-11 L/100km. For savings: Avoid sharp accelerations (turbo consumes more fuel), Use quality fuel (turbo engines are demanding), Regularly service system (turbo requires quality oil)."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate fuel consumption when using 4WD (all-wheel drive)?",
							"a": "4WD increases consumption by 15-25% compared to front or rear wheel drive due to losses in transfer case and additional mass. Calculation: Base consumption (for 2WD), 4WD consumption = Base × 1.2 (average coefficient). Example: 2WD consumption 9 L/100km, 4WD: Consumption = 9 × 1.2 = 10.8 L/100km. For trip of 500 km: Fuel = (10.8 × 500) / 100 = 54 L (without 4WD would be 45 L). Modern 4WD systems (automatic engagement) may reduce consumption in normal conditions, engaging 4WD only when needed. For accurate calculation use real consumption of your 4WD car."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate how much money spent on fuel per month?",
							"a": "Monthly cost calculation: 1) Know monthly mileage (e.g., 2000 km), 2) Know average consumption (e.g., 9 L/100km), 3) Calculate monthly fuel consumption: Consumption = (Mileage × Consumption) / 100, 4) Multiply by price per liter: Cost = Consumption × Price. Example: mileage 2000 km, consumption 9 L/100km, price $0.55/L: Consumption = (2000 × 9) / 100 = 180 L, Cost = 180 × 0.55 = $99/month. For accurate calculation keep refueling journal: Sum all refuelings per month, Sum all expenses, Get exact amount. Can also calculate cost per 1 km: Cost per 1 km = (Consumption per 1 km × Price) = (0.09 × 0.55) = $0.0495/km, then multiply by mileage."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate fuel consumption for car with LPG (gas equipment)?",
							"a": "LPG (liquefied gas) is consumed 15-25% more than gasoline, but costs 2 times cheaper. Calculation: Gasoline consumption (e.g., 10 L/100km), Gas consumption = Gasoline × 1.2 = 12 L/100km, Cost: At gasoline price $0.55/L and gas $0.28/L: Gasoline: 10 × 0.55 = $5.50/100km, Gas: 12 × 0.28 = $3.36/100km. Savings: $5.50 - $3.36 = $2.14/100km (39% savings). Per 20,000 km/year: Savings = $428. Fuel calculation formula same: Fuel = (Consumption × Distance) / 100, but use gas consumption. Example: trip 600 km, gas consumption 12 L/100km: Fuel = (12 × 600) / 100 = 72 L of gas."

							"a": "Most profitable are cars with engine volume up to 1000 cm³ — minimum duty and excise rates ($1.5/cm³). Most expensive — over 3000 cm³ ($3.6/cm³). Optimal range: 1000-2000 cm³ with moderate rates $1.7/cm³."
						},
						{
							"q": "Does car age affect customs clearance cost?",
							"a": "Yes, car age significantly affects customs clearance cost. For cars younger than 3 years excise is 2 times lower. For example, for engine 2000 cm³: under 3 years = $2.5/cm³, over 3 years = $5.0/cm³. Difference can be tens of thousands."
						},
						{
							"q": "Are electric cars exempt from excise?",
							"a": "Yes, electric cars are exempt from excise, as they have no internal combustion engine. Only duty (10% of value) and VAT (20%) are paid. Recycling fee is paid in full. This makes electric cars more profitable for import."
						},

							"a": "Interest rate is percentage rate that determines financing cost in leasing. It includes cost of money, leasing company risks and its profit. Interest rate is usually higher than bank loan rates."
						},
						{
							"q": "What is difference between leasing and car loan?",
							"a": "Main differences: in leasing car remains property of leasing company until buyout, leasing can have tax benefits for business, buyout value affects financing amount, and in loan car immediately becomes property of borrower."
						},
						{
							"q": "What is buyout value in leasing?",
							"a": "Buyout value is amount that needs to be paid to leasing company to transfer car ownership at end of leasing contract. It can be from 0% to 30% of initial car value."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate total leasing cost?",
							"a": "Total leasing cost includes down payment, all monthly payments and buyout value. Formula: Total Cost = Down Payment + (Monthly Payment × Term) + Buyout Value."
						},
						{
							"q": "What documents are needed for leasing?",
							"a": "For leasing usually required: passport, income certificate, employment record, car documents, OSAGO and CASCO insurance policies. For legal entities additionally need founding documents and financial statements."
						},
						{
							"q": "Can leasing be paid off early?",
							"a": "Yes, most leasing companies allow early leasing payoff. With early payoff usually discount on remaining payments is provided or interest rate is reduced. Early payoff conditions are specified in leasing contract."
						},
						{
							"q": "What taxes are paid when leasing car?",
							"a": "When leasing car for individuals VAT is paid on monthly payments. For legal entities leasing payments can reduce taxable base for profit tax, and VAT is accepted for credit."
						},
						{
							"q": "What is down payment in leasing?",
							"a": "Down payment is amount that lessee pays at beginning of leasing contract. Usually is from 10% to 50% of car value. Larger down payment reduces monthly payments and total overpayment."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to choose optimal leasing term?",
							"a": "Optimal leasing term depends on your financial capabilities and plans for car. Short term means less overpayment, but larger monthly payments. Long term reduces monthly burden, but increases total overpayment."
						},
						{
							"q": "Can leasing parameters be changed during process?",
							"a": "Changing leasing parameters during contract is possible only with leasing company consent. Usually can increase down payment, change contract term or buy out car early. All changes are formalized by additional agreements."
						},
						{
							"q": "What are leasing payments and how are they formed?",
							"a": "Leasing payments consist of car depreciation, financing interest, leasing company commission and VAT. Payment amount depends on car value, down payment, contract term and interest rate."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate overpayment for leasing?",
							"a": "Overpayment for leasing is calculated as difference between total sum of all payments and car value. Formula: Overpayment = Total Leasing Cost - Car Value. Overpayment shows how much more expensive leasing is compared to cash purchase."
						},
						{
							"q": "What cars can be leased?",
							"a": "Almost any car can be leased: new and used, passenger and commercial, domestic and imported. Leasing companies usually work with dealers and can offer wide selection of cars of various brands and models."
						},
						{
							"q": "What happens to car at end of leasing contract?",
							"a": "At end of leasing contract lessee has several options: buy out car at buyout value, extend leasing contract, return car to leasing company or exchange for new car. Choice depends on contract conditions and your plans."
						},
						{
							"q": "What interest rate is considered profitable for leasing?",
							"a": "Interest rate in leasing usually is 10-18% annual. Rate up to 12% annual for new cars and up to 15% for used is considered profitable. Rate depends on car value, leasing term, down payment and borrower credit history. Lower rate means less overpayment."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate financing amount in leasing?",
							"a": "Financing amount is calculated as difference between car value, down payment and buyout value. Formula: Financing Amount = Car Value - Down Payment - Buyout Value. This amount is used to calculate monthly payments by annuity formula."
						},
						{
							"q": "Can used car be leased?",
							"a": "Yes, many leasing companies offer used car leasing. Conditions usually are less favorable: higher interest rate (up to 18-20%), shorter lease term, larger down payment required (from 30%). Car age usually shouldn't exceed 5-7 years."
						},
						{
							"q": "How does down payment affect leasing conditions?",
							"a": "Down payment directly affects leasing conditions: larger payment (30-50%) reduces monthly payments and total overpayment, can reduce interest rate, decreases financing amount. Minimum payment (10-20%) increases monthly burden and overpayment, but requires less funds at start."
						},
						{
							"q": "What is more profitable: leasing or car loan?",
							"a": "Depends on situation: Leasing is more profitable for legal entities (tax benefits, VAT credit), when planning to replace car every 3-4 years, when need smaller monthly payments. Car loan is more profitable for individuals (lower overpayment), for long-term car ownership, when possible large down payment. Use calculator to compare specific conditions."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate savings with early leasing payoff?",
							"a": "With early leasing payoff savings are calculated as difference between remaining payment sum and early payoff amount. Usually leasing companies provide discount on remaining payments or recalculate rate. Formula: Savings = (Monthly Payment × Remaining Months) - Early Payoff Amount."
						},
						{
							"q": "What additional expenses when leasing car?",
							"a": "Additional expenses when leasing: OSAGO and CASCO (mandatory), registration fees, total loss insurance (usually included in leasing), contract processing fee (1-3% of value), account maintenance fee (if any). All expenses should be specified in leasing contract."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate overpayment percentage for leasing?",
							"a": "Overpayment percentage is calculated as ratio of overpayment to car value multiplied by 100%. Formula: Overpayment Percentage = (Overpayment / Car Value) × 100%. Example: overpayment $2,000 with value $20,000: Percentage = ($2,000 / $20,000) × 100% = 10%. Usually overpayment is 10-25% of car value."
						},
						{
							"q": "Can car be changed during leasing?",
							"a": "Yes, many leasing companies allow exchanging car for another during leasing contract. Usually this is formalized as early termination of one contract and conclusion of new one. Exchange conditions depend on leasing company and may include additional fees. Exchange for new car of same brand is also possible."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate VAT in leasing payments?",
							"a": "VAT in leasing payments is calculated as 20% of monthly payment amount. Formula: VAT = Monthly Payment × 0.20. Example: payment $500: VAT = $500 × 0.20 = $100. For individuals VAT is included in payment amount, for legal entities VAT can be accepted for credit."
						},
						{
							"q": "What is operating and financial leasing?",
							"a": "Operating lease — short-term (up to 3 years), without buyout right, car is returned to leasing company, lower down payment. Financial lease — long-term (3-7 years), with buyout right, car transfers to ownership, higher down payment, lower interest rate. Financial lease is closer to loan purchase."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate leasing for legal entities?",
							"a": "Leasing calculation for legal entities is similar to individuals, but there are features: Leasing payments reduce taxable base for profit tax, VAT is accepted for credit (20% of payments), accelerated depreciation (coefficient up to 3), preferential rates for some transport categories. Calculation formulas are same, but final benefit is higher due to tax advantages."
						},
						{
							"q": "Can several cars be leased simultaneously?",
							"a": "Yes, leasing on several cars simultaneously can be arranged. Each car is arranged by separate leasing contract. When leasing several cars leasing companies usually provide discounts on commission and improve conditions (interest rate reduction, lease term increase). This is profitable for companies with fleet."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate optimal down payment for leasing?",
							"a": "Optimal down payment depends on your capabilities and goals: For minimum overpayment — 30-50% of value. For minimum monthly burden — 10-20% of value. For balance — 20-30% of value. Use calculator to calculate different options and choose optimal by your criteria."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to choose leasing company?",
							"a": "When choosing leasing company consider: Reputation and market experience (minimum 5-10 years), Interest rate size (compare several companies), Flexibility of conditions (ability to change parameters, early payoff), Transparency of conditions (all fees should be specified in contract), Document processing speed, Customer reviews. It's recommended to get offers from 3-5 leasing companies and compare them using calculator."

				"faq": {
					"title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
					"faqItems": [
						{
							"q": "How to calculate car loan?",
							"a": "Car loan is calculated by standard formulas: for annuity payments annuity formula is used, for differentiated — fixed principal plus interest on balance. Use our calculator by entering car value, down payment, term, interest rate and payment type."
						},
						{
							"q": "What is car loan interest rate?",
							"a": "Car loan interest rate depends on many factors: loan amount (usually 9-18% annual), down payment (larger payment means lower rate), loan term, car age (rate is lower for new car), borrower credit history. Average rate is 11-14% annual."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate monthly car loan payment?",
							"a": "Monthly payment is calculated depending on type: Annuity = Amount × (Rate × (1+Rate)^Term) / ((1+Rate)^Term - 1). Differentiated = (Principal / Term) + (Balance × Rate). Example: loan $12,000 for 5 years at 12%, annuity: payment = $266.93/month."
						},
						{
							"q": "What is car loan overpayment?",
							"a": "Car loan overpayment depends on amount, term and rate. Examples: loan $10,000 for 3 years at 12% — overpayment ~$2,000 (20%). For 5 years at 12% — overpayment ~$3,320 (33%). For 7 years at 11% — overpayment ~$4,620 (46%). Longer term and higher rate means more overpayment."
						},
						{
							"q": "Car loan with or without down payment?",
							"a": "Car loan with down payment is more profitable: effective loan amount decreases, interest rate usually lower by 1-3%, overpayment less. Down payment 20-30% is optimal. Loan without down payment is possible, but rate is higher by 2-5%, CASCO required, loan amount may be limited."
						},
						{
							"q": "What is better: annuity or differentiated payment for car loan?",
							"a": "With same rate differentiated payment is more profitable — overpayment less by 3-7%. But first payments are higher. Annuity is more convenient for budget — payment is same for entire term. Choose differentiated if you can afford larger first payments. Annuity — if need stable budget."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate early payoff for car loan?",
							"a": "With early payoff schedule is recalculated: debt balance decreases, interest is recalculated. Savings depend on amount and term of early payoff. Example: loan $15,000, 5 years, 12%, early payoff $2,000 after year saves ~$1,800 interest. Use calculator for accurate calculation."
						},
						{
							"q": "What is optimal car loan term?",
							"a": "Optimal term depends on financial capabilities. Short term (3-4 years): less overpayment, but higher monthly payment. Medium term (5 years): balance between payment and overpayment. Long term (6-7 years): lower payment, but more overpayment. Term 4-5 years is recommended, with overpayment 30-35%."
						},
						{
							"q": "Car loan for new or used car?",
							"a": "For new car: rate lower (9-12%), term up to 7 years, amount up to 100% of value, no inspection required. For used: rate higher (12-18%), term up to 5 years, inspection required, age and mileage restrictions. New car is more profitable by rate, but more expensive to buy."
						},
						{
							"q": "How much down payment needed for car loan?",
							"a": "Minimum down payment usually 10-20% of car value. Optimal 20-30% — reduces rate by 1-3% and overpayment. Some banks require minimum 15-25% for used cars. Larger down payment means more profitable loan conditions."
						},
						{
							"q": "Is CASCO mandatory with car loan?",
							"a": "Yes, CASCO is mandatory with car loan at most banks until full loan payoff. This is collateral (car) protection for bank. CASCO cost 5-10% of car value annually. Account for this in budget: with car value $15,000 CASCO will cost $750-$1,500/year."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to reduce car loan overpayment?",
							"a": "Ways to reduce overpayment: 1) Increase down payment — reduces loan amount. 2) Choose shorter term — less interest. 3) Choose differentiated payments instead of annuity. 4) Find loan with lower rate. 5) Make early payments — most effective in first years."
						},
						{
							"q": "What documents needed for car loan?",
							"a": "Main documents: passport, income certificate (2-NDFL or bank form), driver license, car documents (title, purchase agreement), CASCO insurance policy. Additionally may be required: military ID (for men), property documents (to confirm solvency)."
						},
						{
							"q": "What is maximum car loan amount?",
							"a": "Maximum amount depends on bank and car value. Usually 100% of value for new car (up to $50,000-$100,000), 70-80% for used. Some banks give up to 95% of new car value and up to 85% of used car value. Limit also depends on borrower income — payment shouldn't exceed 40-50% of income."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate car loan overpayment percentage?",
							"a": "Overpayment Percentage = (Overpayment / Loan Amount) × 100%. Example: loan $10,000, overpayment $3,300, overpayment percentage = ($3,300 / $10,000) × 100% = 33%. Overpayment is calculated as total payments minus loan amount. Calculator automatically shows overpayment percentage."
						},
						{
							"q": "Car loan or leasing: which is more profitable?",
							"a": "Car loan is more profitable when planning long-term ownership — after loan payoff car becomes completely yours. Leasing is more profitable for business (tax benefits) and when frequently changing cars. With car loan you are owner from first day. With leasing — until buyout. Compare both options using calculators."
						},
						{
							"q": "Can I get car loan without driver license?",
							"a": "Usually driver license is mandatory for getting car loan, as bank checks ability to drive car. However some banks may approve loan if there is driving possibility (e.g., license in process or driving by another person). Check conditions at specific bank."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate how much can I get in car loan?",
							"a": "Maximum Amount = Minimum of (Car Value × Financing Percentage) and (Income × Solvency Coefficient × Term). Example: car $20,000, financing 80%, income $1,000/month, coefficient 40%, term 5 years: Maximum = min($20,000 × 0.8; $1,000 × 0.4 × 60) = min($16,000; $24,000) = $16,000."
						},
						{
							"q": "What interest rate to choose for car loan?",
							"a": "Choose lowest available rate, but account for all conditions: hidden fees, mandatory services (insurance), early payoff possibility. Low rate with large fees may be worse than high rate without fees. Compare effective interest rate (APR) at different banks."
						},
						{
							"q": "What is APR (total cost of credit) for car loan?",
							"a": "APR is real credit cost accounting for all payments, including interest, fees, insurance. APR is always higher than interest rate. For example, with rate 12% APR may be 15-18% due to fees and CASCO. Bank must specify APR in contract. Compare loans by APR, not by interest rate."
						},
						{
							"q": "Can car loan be refinanced?",
							"a": "Yes, car loan refinancing is possible: can arrange new loan at another bank on more favorable conditions to pay off old one. Refinancing conditions: current loan paid for minimum 6-12 months, no delays, new rate must be lower by minimum 2%. Refinancing allows reducing payment or overpayment."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate car loan payment schedule?",
							"a": "Payment schedule is calculated by months with breakdown into principal and interest. For annuity: payment is constant, but interest share decreases. For differentiated: principal is constant, interest decreases, total payment decreases. Calculator automatically generates schedule for entire loan term. Can download in CSV format."
						},
						{
							"q": "Car loan with government support: how to calculate?",
							"a": "Government support reduces interest rate on car loan for certain categories (young families, large families, budget workers). Preferential rate usually 2-5% lower than market. Calculation is similar to regular car loan, but use preferential rate. Example: regular rate 12%, preferential 9%, savings ~$1,500 on loan $15,000 for 5 years."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate overpayment with early car loan payoff?",
							"a": "With early payoff overpayment decreases, as interest accrual period decreases. Savings = Interest that wouldn't be accrued due to term reduction. Example: loan $12,000, 5 years, 12%, early payoff $3,000 after 2 years saves ~$2,000 interest and reduces term by ~14 months. Use calculator for accurate calculation."
						},
						{
							"q": "Which banks give car loan on best conditions?",
							"a": "Car loan conditions differ by banks. Large banks (Sberbank, VTB, Alfa-Bank, Raiffeisen) usually have competitive rates 10-13% on new cars. Specialized dealer car loan programs may offer rates from 6.9%. Compare offers from minimum 3-5 banks, use calculator for accurate overpayment comparison."
						},
						{
							"q": "Car loan with payment deferral: how to calculate?",
							"a": "Payment deferral (grace period) is period without payments at beginning of loan. Usually 1-3 months. When calculating with deferral interest accumulates for deferral period and is added to loan amount. Example: loan $15,000, deferral 2 months, rate 12%: interest for deferral = $15,000 × 0.12 × 2/12 = $300. Effective amount = $15,300."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate car loan accounting for CASCO?",
							"a": "CASCO with car loan is added to total ownership cost. Calculation example with CASCO: car value $15,000, loan $12,000 for 5 years at 12%, CASCO 10% of value ($1,500/year or $125/month). Monthly loan payment $266.93 + CASCO $125 = $391.93/month. Total overpayment: loan interest + CASCO for 5 years ≈ $7,500."
						},
						{
							"q": "Car loan for electric car: what rates?",
							"a": "Car loan for electric car often has preferential conditions: rate 6.5-9.5% annual (lower by 2-4% from regular), government subsidies, possibility of loan up to 95% of value. Example: electric car $40,000, preferential rate 9.5%, term 6 years: monthly payment ~$700 with down payment 20%. Use preferential rate in calculator."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate if car loan is profitable?",
							"a": "Assess car loan profitability: compare total cost of credit purchase and cash, account for overpayment, CASCO cost, possibility of investing down payment. If investment income is higher than overpayment — credit is more profitable. If not — saving is more profitable. With low interest rate (up to 10%) car loan may be more profitable than saving for long term."
						},
						{
							"q": "What hidden fees in car loan?",
							"a": "Hidden fees may include: loan issuance fee (0.5-2% of amount), account maintenance fee ($30-$100/month), early payoff fee (some banks), mandatory services (life insurance). Bank must specify APR (total cost of credit), which includes all fees. Compare loans by APR, not by interest rate."

				"faq": {
					"title": "Frequently Asked Questions About LPG Payback",
					"faqItems": [
						{
							"q": "How long does LPG pay back?",
							"a": "LPG payback period depends on installation cost, annual mileage, fuel consumption and price difference between gasoline and gas. Usually LPG pays back in 1-3 years with mileage from 15000-20000 km/year. With high mileage (30000+ km/year) payback may be 6-12 months."
						},
						{
							"q": "Is it profitable to install LPG on car?",
							"a": "LPG is profitable with high annual mileage (from 15000-20000 km/year) and significant price difference between gasoline and gas (usually gas is 30-40% cheaper). With low mileage (less than 10000 km/year) payback may exceed 3-4 years, making installation less attractive."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate LPG savings?",
							"a": "Savings = (Annual Mileage × Gasoline Consumption / 100 × Gasoline Price) - (Annual Mileage × Gas Consumption / 100 × Gas Price). For example, with mileage 20000 km/year, gasoline consumption 10 L/100km (price $5.50/L), gas consumption 12 L/100km (price $3.50/L): Savings = $11,000 - $8,400 = $2,600/year."
						},
						{
							"q": "What is gas consumption compared to gasoline?",
							"a": "Gas consumption is usually 10-20% higher than gasoline consumption due to lower gas heat of combustion. If car consumes 10 L gasoline per 100 km, gas consumption will be approximately 11-12 L per 100 km. This is normal difference and is accounted for in savings calculation."
						},
						{
							"q": "How much does LPG installation cost?",
							"a": "LPG installation cost depends on equipment type, engine cylinder count and region. On average 4th generation LPG installation costs $3,500-$5,000, 5th generation LPG - $5,000-$8,000. 6th generation LPG may cost $8,000-$12,000."
						},
						{
							"q": "What is LPG payback period with mileage 15000 km per year?",
							"a": "With mileage 15000 km/year and price difference between gasoline and gas $2/L LPG payback will be approximately 2-2.5 years. With higher mileage payback is faster, with lower - slower. Exact calculation depends on fuel consumption and prices in region."
						},
						{
							"q": "Why is gas consumption higher than gasoline consumption?",
							"a": "Gas has lower heat of combustion compared to gasoline (about 46 MJ/kg for propane vs 44 MJ/kg for gasoline), but due to lower energy density per unit volume consumption in liters is 10-20% higher. This is normal and accounted for in calculations."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate LPG payback period?",
							"a": "Payback Period = Installation Cost / (Annual Savings / 12). For example, installation $4,500, annual savings $2,600: Payback Period = $4,500 / ($2,600 / 12) = $4,500 / $216.67 = 20.8 months ≈ 1.7 years."
						},
						{
							"q": "Is LPG profitable with low mileage?",
							"a": "With low mileage (less than 10000-15000 km/year) LPG may pay back in 3-4 years or more, making installation less attractive. However if you plan to increase mileage or keep car long, installation may be justified."
						},
						{
							"q": "What price difference between gasoline and gas should be for profitable LPG installation?",
							"a": "For profitable LPG installation difference should be at least $1.50-$2/L. With smaller difference payback may exceed 3-4 years. Optimal difference is $2-$3/L, which ensures payback in 1-2 years with mileage 20000+ km/year."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to account for LPG maintenance when calculating payback?",
							"a": "When calculating payback account for LPG maintenance cost: gas filter replacement ($200-$300 every 10000-15000 km), equipment tuning ($100-$200 once a year). This may increase payback period by 2-3 months."
						},
						{
							"q": "Will LPG pay back in one year?",
							"a": "LPG pays back in one year with high mileage (30000+ km/year) and significant price difference between gasoline and gas ($2+/L). With average mileage 20000 km/year payback is 1.5-2 years, with low mileage (10000 km/year) - 3-4 years."
						},
						{
							"q": "What mileage needed for fast LPG payback?",
							"a": "For fast LPG payback (6-12 months) high mileage is needed - from 30000 km/year and more. With such mileage fuel savings are significant and quickly cover installation cost. For commercial transport this is normal mileage."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate savings per 1 km when using LPG?",
							"a": "Savings per 1 km = (Gasoline Consumption / 100 × Gasoline Price) - (Gas Consumption / 100 × Gas Price). For example, gasoline consumption 10 L/100km ($5.50/L), gas 12 L/100km ($3.50/L): Savings = (10/100 × 5.50) - (12/100 × 3.50) = 0.55 - 0.42 = $0.13/km."
						},
						{
							"q": "Does engine type affect LPG payback?",
							"a": "Engine type affects fuel consumption and installation cost. On injection engines installation is simpler and cheaper, on carburetor - more complex. Gas consumption depends on engine type, but usually 10-20% higher than gasoline consumption."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate LPG payback for truck?",
							"a": "For trucks with high mileage (50000+ km/year) LPG pays back very quickly - in 6-12 months. Formula is same: Payback Period = Installation Cost / (Annual Savings / 12). High consumption and high mileage provide significant savings."
						},
						{
							"q": "Is engine power loss accounted for in calculation?",
							"a": "Engine power loss on gas is usually 5-10% and may slightly affect consumption and savings. However this effect is usually small and not critical for payback calculation. Most drivers don't notice significant difference."
						},
						{
							"q": "How often does LPG need maintenance?",
							"a": "LPG requires regular maintenance: gas filter replacement every 10000-15000 km ($200-$300), equipment tuning once a year ($100-$200), checking connection tightness. These expenses should be accounted for when calculating payback."
						},
						{
							"q": "Can LPG be installed on diesel engine?",
							"a": "On diesel engines not LPG (gas) is installed, but LPG for diesel (methane) or dual-fuel systems. Such systems are more expensive and complex, payback may be different. Usually methane equipment installation is considered."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate LPG payback with price difference $2.50/L?",
							"a": "With difference $2.50/L and mileage 20000 km/year, gasoline consumption 10 L/100km: Savings = 20000 × 10 / 100 × 2.50 = $5,000/year. With installation cost $4,500: Payback Period = $4,500 / ($5,000 / 12) = 10.8 months ≈ 11 months."
						},
						{
							"q": "What savings in first year of LPG use?",
							"a": "Savings in first year = Annual Savings - (Installation Cost / Payback Period in years). For example, annual savings $2,600, installation $4,500, payback period 1.7 years: Savings in first year = $2,600 - ($4,500 / 1.7) = $2,600 - $2,647.06 = -$47.06 (not yet paid back)."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate savings over 3 years of LPG use?",
							"a": "Savings over 3 years = (Annual Savings × 3) - Installation Cost. For example, annual savings $2,600, installation $4,500: Savings over 3 years = ($2,600 × 3) - $4,500 = $7,800 - $4,500 = $3,300."
						},
						{
							"q": "Does LPG type (generation) affect payback?",
							"a": "LPG type affects installation cost: 4th generation LPG is cheaper ($3,500-$5,000), but may have higher consumption. 5th generation LPG is more expensive ($5,000-$8,000), but more economical. More expensive equipment pays back longer, but may give better savings."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate LPG payback for several cars?",
							"a": "To calculate total payback for several cars sum installation cost of all cars and total annual savings: Total Payback Period = Total Installation Cost / (Total Annual Savings / 12)."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to account for fuel price changes in calculation?",
							"a": "When calculating payback use current gasoline and gas prices. If prices change, recalculate savings. Usually gas prices grow slower than gasoline prices, which may improve payback over time."
						},
						{
							"q": "Is LPG profitable on old car?",
							"a": "LPG on old car may be profitable if long-term operation and sufficient mileage are planned. However consider that installation cost should be commensurate with car value. On very old car installation may be unjustified."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate LPG payback accounting for discounts and promotions?",
							"a": "When calculating account for real installation cost with discounts and promotions. 10-20% discount on installation may reduce payback period by 2-3 months. Use current installation price in calculations."
						},
						{
							"q": "What is minimum mileage for LPG payback?",
							"a": "Minimum mileage for LPG payback in reasonable period (2-3 years) is 15000-20000 km/year with price difference between gasoline and gas $2/L. With lower mileage payback exceeds 3-4 years, which may be unprofitable."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate LPG payback when using loan for installation?",
							"a": "When using loan account for interest: Actual Installation Cost = Installation Cost + Loan Interest. Payback Period = Actual Cost / (Annual Savings / 12). Loan increases payback period, but may allow installing LPG immediately."
						},
						{
							"q": "Does region affect LPG payback?",
							"a": "Region affects gasoline and gas prices, which directly affects payback. In regions with large price difference ($2+/L) payback is faster. Also in regions with developed gas station network it's more convenient to use LPG."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate LPG payback with partial gas use?",
							"a": "With partial gas use (e.g., 70% on gas, 30% on gasoline) recalculate savings: Savings = (Annual Savings × Gas Use Share). For example, if using gas 70% of time: Savings = $2,600 × 0.7 = $1,820/year, payback period will increase."
						},
						{
							"q": "What difference should be between gasoline and gas price?",
							"a": "For profitable LPG installation difference between gasoline and gas price should be at least $1.50-$2/L. Optimal difference is $2-$3/L. With smaller difference payback may exceed 3-4 years, making installation less attractive."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate LPG payback accounting for tax benefits?",
							"a": "In some regions there are tax benefits on vehicle tax when using LPG (reduction by 10-30%). Account for this savings in calculation: Total Savings = Fuel Savings + Tax Savings. This may reduce payback period."
						},
						{
							"q": "Is LPG profitable with mileage less than 10000 km per year?",
							"a": "With mileage less than 10000 km/year LPG pays back very long (4-5 years and more), making installation unprofitable. In such cases LPG installation is usually not recommended, unless there are plans to increase mileage."
						},
						{
							"q": "How to calculate LPG payback accounting for inflation?",
							"a": "For long-term calculation (3+ years) account for fuel price inflation. Usually gas prices grow slower than gasoline, which may improve payback over time. For accurate calculation use price growth forecasts or current prices with adjustment."
