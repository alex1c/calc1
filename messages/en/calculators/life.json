              "q": "Is it possible to eat everything and lose weight with a calorie deficit?",
              "a": "Theoretically, you can lose weight on any food with a calorie deficit (“IIFYM” - if it fits your macros). However, for health it is important to get enough proteins, vitamins, and minerals. Fast food and sweets in limited quantities are acceptable, but it is better to focus on whole foods."

              "a": "For vegetarians, the calculation of BMR and TDEE is the same - the Harris-Benedict formula. The difference is in the choice of foods: use legumes, tofu, nuts, seeds as sources of protein. The calculator's database includes vegetarian products. It is important to ensure adequate amounts of protein and vitamin B12."

              "q": "Does genetics affect your daily calorie intake?",
              "a": "Genetics can influence metabolism within ±5-10% of calculated BMR. The Harris-Benedict formula gives population averages. If your metabolism is different, adjust calories based on actual results: if you are not losing weight in a deficit, increase the deficit by 100-200 kcal."

            {
              "q": "How often should you recalculate your daily calorie intake?",
              "a": "Recalculate your daily intake if your weight changes by 3-5 kg, your activity level changes, or your goal changes (weight loss/maintenance/gain). If your weight and lifestyle are stable, it is enough to check once every 2-3 months. Use the calorie calculator for up-to-date calculations."

              "q": "Which is better: counting calories or portions?",
              "a": "Calorie counting is a more accurate and flexible method, especially for weight loss and mass gain. Counting portions is easier, but less accurate. It is best to combine: count calories most of the time, use portions when traveling or in a hurry. The calorie calculator will help you master the correct portions."

              "q": "How to count calories during intermittent fasting?",
              "a": "With intermittent fasting, the calculation of calories does not change - the total amount per day is important, not the time of intake. TDEE is calculated the same way. The difference is that you eat in a smaller window of time. You still need to meet your daily quota to achieve your goals."

              "q": "How many grams of fat does a man need per day?",
              "a": "The daily intake of fat for a man is 0.9-1 g per kg of weight or 20-30% of the total calorie content. With a weight of 80 kg, this is 72-80 g of fat (648-720 kcal). The right fats are important: omega-3 (fish, flaxseed oil), monounsaturated (olive oil, avocado), a minimum of trans fats."

            {
              "q": "How to calculate BJU in a finished dish?",
              "a": "To calculate the BJU in a dish, sum up the BJU of all ingredients by weight: weigh each ingredient, find the BJU per 100g, recalculate by the weight of the ingredient, add everything up and divide into portions. Use food calorie tables or a calorie calculator for accuracy."
            },
            {
              "q": "Does the level of activity affect the norm of BJU?",
              "a": "Yes, activity level affects TDEE (daily energy intake), which is then allocated to BJU. With high activity there are more total calories and therefore more carbohydrates for energy. Proteins remain stable (1.8 g/kg), fats too (0.9 g/kg), mainly carbohydrates increase."
            },
            {
              "q": "What formula is used to calculate BZHU?",
              "a": "The BJU calculation is based on the Harris-Benedict formula for BMR, then multiplied by the activity coefficient for TDEE, and the distribution is: protein = weight × 1.8 g (× 4 kcal), fat = weight × 0.9 g (× 9 kcal), carbohydrates = (TDEE − protein − fat) / 4 kcal. The calculator automatically performs all calculations."
            },
            {
              "q": "What are macronutrients and why count them?",
              "a": "Macronutrients are proteins, fats and carbohydrates, the three main components of nutrition. Counting macros helps you control not only calories, but also the quality of your diet: enough protein for muscles, the right fats for health, carbohydrates for energy. This is a more accurate approach than just counting calories."
            },
            {
              "q": "How much protein should you eat to maintain muscle while losing weight?",
              "a": "To maintain muscle mass while losing weight, you need 1.6-2 g of protein per kg of weight, which is higher than the usual norm. This is because when you are in a calorie deficit, the body can use protein as an energy source, so you need more of it to protect your muscles. With a weight of 70 kg, this is 112-140 g of protein per day."
            },
            {
              "q": "Is it possible to eat fewer carbohydrates to lose weight?",
              "a": "Yes, low-carb diets are effective for weight loss, but it's important not to go too low. The minimum amount of carbohydrates depends on the level of activity: with a sedentary lifestyle, 50-100 g is possible; during training, you need more (150-200 g) for energy. Proteins and fats remain at the same level."
            },
            {
              "q": "How to distribute BJU throughout the day?",
              "a": "Distribute BJU evenly throughout the day: proteins in each meal (20-40 g), fats evenly, more carbohydrates in the first half of the day and after training. For breakfast you can have more carbohydrates for energy, for dinner - more proteins and less carbohydrates. The main thing is to meet the daily requirement."
            },
            {
              "q": "What is the BJU 40/30/30 ratio?",
              "a": "The BJU ratio of 40/30/30 means 40% calories from carbohydrates, 30% from proteins, 30% from fats. This is a popular ratio for weight maintenance. For example, at 2000 kcal: proteins 150 g (600 kcal), fats 67 g (600 kcal), carbohydrates 200 g (800 kcal). It is not suitable for everyone, it is better to calculate individually."

            {
              "q": "How to calculate BJU for a keto diet?",
              "a": "For the keto diet, the BJU ratio is: 5-10% carbohydrates (20-50 g), 70-80% fats, 15-25% proteins (1.2-1.5 g/kg). With a weight of 70 kg: proteins 84-105 g, fats 150-200 g, carbohydrates 20-50 g. It is important to consult a doctor before starting a keto diet. The calculator allows you to adjust the ratio manually."
            },
            {
              "q": "How much protein fat carbohydrates does an athlete need?",
              "a": "For athletes, the BJU norm is: proteins 1.8-2.5 g/kg (depending on the type of sport), fats 1-1.2 g/kg, carbohydrates 4-7 g/kg for endurance, 3-5 g/kg for strength. With a weight of 80 kg and high activity: proteins 144-200 g, fats 80-96 g, carbohydrates 320-560 g. More carbohydrates for recovery after training."
            },
            {
              "q": "How to calculate BJU without a calculator?",
              "a": "Without a calculator: calculate BMR using the Harris-Benedict formula, multiply by the activity factor for TDEE, apply goal adjustment (±15%), then distribute: protein = weight × 1.8 × 4 kcal, fat = weight × 0.9 × 9 kcal, carbohydrates = (TDEE − protein − fat) / 4 kcal. The calculator does this automatically."
            },
            {
              "q": "What is the norm of BZHU for weight maintenance?",
              "a": "For weight maintenance, BJU is calculated based on TDEE without deficit/surplus. Standard distribution: proteins 1.6-1.8 g/kg, fats 0.9-1 g/kg, carbohydrates - the remaining calories. With a weight of 70 kg and TDEE 2200 kcal: proteins 112-126 g (448-504 kcal), fats 63-70 g (567-630 kcal), carbohydrates 1066-1185 kcal (267-296 g)."
            },
            {
              "q": "What percentage of BJU is best for gaining muscle mass?",
              "a": "For weight gain, the optimal ratio of BJU is: proteins 25-30% (1.8-2.2 g/kg), fats 20-25% (0.9-1 g/kg), carbohydrates 45-55% (the rest). With a surplus of 15-20% and strength training, this ensures muscle growth. For example, with a TDEE of 2800 kcal and a surplus of 15% (3220 kcal): proteins 161 g, fats 80 g, carbohydrates 363 g."
            },
            {
              "q": "Is it possible to eat more protein than the recommended amount?",
              "a": "Yes, you can eat more protein, especially when losing or gaining weight. The upper safe limit for healthy people is 2.5-3 g/kg body weight. Excess may be beneficial for satiety and muscle preservation when in a calorie deficit. However, very high protein intake (more than 3 g/kg) does not provide additional benefits and may put strain on the kidneys."
            },
            {
              "q": "Does age affect the norm of BJU?",
              "a": "Age affects BMR (basal metabolic rate), which is calculated using the Harris-Benedict formula taking into account age. After 30 years, metabolism slows down by 1-2% per year. However, the BJU norm (proteins 1.8 g/kg, fats 0.9 g/kg) remains relatively stable, only the total calorie content changes. Older adults may require more protein (up to 2 g/kg) to maintain muscle."
            },
            {
              "q": "How to calculate BJU for pregnant women?",
              "a": "For pregnant women, the calculation of BZHU is similar to the usual one, but calories are added to TDEE: I trimester +0 kcal, II trimester +340 kcal, III trimester +452 kcal. Distribution of BJU: proteins increase to 1.8-2 g/kg (important for fetal growth), fats and carbohydrates remain within normal limits. Consultation with a doctor is required for individual recommendations."
            },
            {
              "q": "Which is better: counting calories or calorie counting?",
              "a": "It is better to count both calories and dietary fat at the same time. Calories control overall energy (deficit/surplus), BZHU ensure the correct quality of nutrition. For example, you can meet the calories, but not enough protein or too much fat. BZHU control helps to achieve goals faster and better. Use the BZHU calculator for a comprehensive approach."
            },
            {
              "q": "How to recalculate BZHU when weight changes?",
              "a": "When changing weight, recalculate the BJU: proteins and fats are recalculated to the new weight (proteins = new weight × 1.8, fats = new weight × 0.9), carbohydrates are calculated from the new TDEE. When losing 5 kg: proteins decrease by 9 g, fats by 4.5 g, total calorie content decreases by ~250 kcal. Recalculate every 3-5 kg ​​of weight change."

            {
              "q": "What foods are rich in protein for BJU?",
              "a": "High protein foods: chicken breast (30g/100g), turkey (29g), fish (20-25g), eggs (13g/piece), cottage cheese (16-18g), buckwheat (13g), oatmeal (12g), legumes (20-25g), nuts (15-25g), tofu (16g). Use a variety of protein sources throughout the day for a complete amino acid profile."

            {
              "q": "What carbohydrates are best included in BJU?",
              "a": "Choose complex carbohydrates with a low glycemic index: cereals (buckwheat, oatmeal, brown rice), whole grain bread, vegetables, legumes, fruits (in moderation). Limit simple carbohydrates (sweets, white bread, soda) - they are digested faster and can cause sugar spikes. Complex carbohydrates provide energy evenly throughout the day."

              "q": "How to count BJU in restaurant dishes?",
              "a": "For restaurant dishes, BJU is difficult to calculate accurately. Use estimates of similar dishes from the database, increase by 20-30% (restaurants often add more oil and sugar). It’s better to cook at home, weigh the ingredients and count the BJU accurately. Save recipes with BJU calculations for reuse."
            },
            {
              "q": "Do I need to change the BJU on training days?",
              "a": "It is not necessary to change the general norm of BJU, but you can redistribute it throughout the day: before training, more carbohydrates for energy, after training, more proteins for muscle recovery and carbohydrates to replenish glycogen. The total number of BJUs per day remains the same. With frequent training (6-7 per week), you can increase your total caloric intake by 10-15%."

              "a": "With intermittent fasting, the calculation of BZHU does not change - the total amount per day is important, not the time of intake. Calculate your daily intake of BJU as usual, then distribute it over your eating window (for example, 8 hours). Try to fit all your protein, fat and carbohydrate intake into this window. The total amount of BJU is more important than the time of consumption."

              "a": "Determining the exact date of conception is difficult, since fertilization can occur within several days after ovulation, and sperm live in a woman’s body for up to 5 days. However, if the date of ovulation is known (by tests, ultrasound or measurement of basal temperature), then conception usually occurs on the day of ovulation or within 1-2 days after it."

The expected date of birth is calculated as usual (from PM + 280 days), but often birth occurs 2-3 weeks earlier. This is due to the fact that the uterus stretches more when carrying several fetuses."

              "q": "Why do doctors use the date of the last menstrual period for calculations?",
              "a": "Doctors use the date of the last menstrual period (LMP) because it is more accurately known to most women than the date of conception. This is a standard method accepted in obstetrics throughout the world. The method is based on the fact that the menstrual cycle begins on the first day of menstruation, and ovulation occurs approximately 2 weeks later. This allows us to unify calculations for all women."

For example, if the birth date is October 7, and today is April 1, then the time left until the birth is: October 7 - April 1 = approximately 190 days. The calculator automatically calculates this value when you enter the current date. A negative value means that the pregnancy is post-term."

              "a": "Yes, the estimated date of birth can be adjusted by the doctor after the first ultrasound at 11-13 weeks, when the size of the fetus and its gestational age are accurately determined. An ultrasound may show that the actual gestational age differs from the PM calculation by several days. In this case, the doctor can recalculate the maximum allowance. Typically the correction is ±5-7 days."

              "a": "The most accurate calculation method is based on the date of IVF (in vitro fertilization), accuracy ±3 days, since the date of embryo transfer is known exactly. The second most accurate is by the date of conception (±5 days), if it is known exactly. Less accurate - by the date of the last menstruation (±7 days), but it is the most common, since most women know this date."

              "a": "With an irregular cycle, calculation based on the date of the last menstruation is less accurate. In this case, it is better to use the date of conception (if known), an ultrasound in the first trimester (11-13 weeks) to determine the exact date, or the date of IVF (the most accurate method). The first ultrasound gives the most accurate gestational age, regardless of the regularity of the cycle. The doctor can correct the PDR after an ultrasound."

              "a": "Calculating the gestational age after a cesarean section is no different from usual. The same method is used - from the first day of the last menstruation or from the date of conception. A previous caesarean section does not affect the length of the next pregnancy. However, it is important to consider that after a cesarean, the next cesarean may be planned at 38-39 weeks, but this is decided by the doctor."

The child should stand straight, bare feet, heels together, back straight. The head should be in a neutral position (line of sight parallel to the floor). Measure from the top of your head to your soles. For children under 2 years old, measure height while lying down (body length). Enter the result in centimeters into the height calculator."

Weigh the child on an empty stomach, in the morning, after using the toilet, without clothes or in minimal light clothing (subtract the weight of clothing). For babies, use special baby scales with an accuracy of 10-50 grams. Enter your weight in kilograms into the baby weight calculator. Regular weighing allows you to track your weight gain."

              "a": "If a child's height is below the 5th percentile, it means that less than 5% of children of the same age and gender are shorter than your child. This may indicate possible growth retardation and requires consultation with a pediatrician or endocrinologist. The reasons may be different: genetic factors, diseases, poor diet, hormonal disorders. It is important not to panic, but to see a doctor for a full examination."

              "a": "If a child's weight is above the 95th percentile, it means that more than 95% of children of the same age and gender weigh less. This may indicate excess weight, especially if combined with low physical activity. Talk to your pediatrician about diet and physical activity. It is important to assess whether the weight is proportional to height - perhaps the child is simply large, which is a variant of the norm."

For children over 5 years of age, different growth standards (CDC standards or national guidelines) are used. WHO standards for up to 5 years are considered the most accurate for early childhood. For children 5-18 years old, there are separate calculators and growth tables that take into account puberty and other developmental features."

However, the interpretation of BMI for children is different - special percentile tables are used by age and gender. The height and weight calculator automatically estimates weight for height, which is more accurate than BMI for young children."

              "a": "Tracking height percentiles over time is important because it allows you to assess the dynamics of physical development. If your height percentile drops or rises sharply, it may indicate health problems. A stable percentile (even if it is below or above the average) is often a variant of the norm. A sharp change in percentile requires consultation with a doctor. A percentile growth graph helps visualize development dynamics."

Interpretation: <5% - below normal (possible delay), 5-25% - below average (minor deviation), 25-75% - normal (most children), 75-95% - above average (rapid development), >95% - above normal (deviations possible). It is important to evaluate height and weight together: if both measures are proportional, this is usually normal, even if they deviate from the median."

              "a": "Yes, adjusted growth standards are used for premature babies. The calculation is based on the corrected age (chronological age minus the number of weeks of prematurity). For example, if a baby is 6 months old but was born 2 months early, the corrected age is 4 months. The growth calculator for prematurity should take into account the corrected age up to 2-3 years. After this, the difference usually disappears and the standard age can be used."

              "a": "Yes, nutrition significantly affects a child’s height and weight. Inadequate or malnutrition can lead to stunting in height and weight (low percentiles). Excessive nutrition, especially high-calorie nutrition, can lead to excess weight (high weight percentiles). Breastfeeding up to 6 months and proper introduction of complementary foods are important for normal physical development. The growth calculator helps you assess whether your current diet is appropriate for development."

              "a": "Yes, the height calculator can be used for newborns (from 0 months). However, measurements of newborns require special accuracy: height is measured in a lying position (body length), weight - on special children's scales. Growth standards for newborns differ from older children and take into account birth weight, gestational age, and gender. The calculator shows WHO norms for babies from birth, but interpretation of the results requires consultation with a neonatologist or pediatrician."

Typically this is a range between the 25th and 75th percentile or between the 10th and 90th percentile. If a child's height extends beyond its dental corridor (the percentile changes sharply), this may indicate health problems. Percentile stability is more important than absolute growth values."

              "a": "The height of the parents (genetic factors) significantly influences the height of the child. There is a formula for predicting final height: for boys - (father's height + mother's height + 13) / 2, for girls - (father's height + mother's height - 13) / 2. However, the child's current height may deviate from the predicted one within 8-10 cm. The height calculator estimates the current development relative to peers, but the genetic potential can manifest itself gradually."

              "a": "If the child's height and weight do not meet WHO standards (especially if the percentiles are <5% or >95%), it is recommended to consult a pediatrician. The doctor will conduct a full examination, evaluate the developmental history, nutrition, and possible diseases. Don't panic - deviations can be a variant of the norm (genetics, individual characteristics). It is important to monitor the dynamics of development and follow the doctor’s recommendations on nutrition, physical activity and possible treatment."

To assess the anthropometry of a child, use the height and weight calculator: enter the gender, exact age in months (for children under one year), height in centimeters and weight in kilograms. The calculator will calculate percentiles of height and weight according to WHO standards, which is the basis of anthropometric assessment. Additionally, head and chest circumference can be measured, but these parameters are not taken into account in the standard height calculator."

If both indicators are in the same percentile range (for example, height 50th percentile, weight 55th percentile), development is harmonious. If the percentiles are very different (for example, height 90th percentile, weight 10th percentile), this may indicate problems. The growth calculator automatically evaluates the harmonious development and makes recommendations in case of significant deviations."

            {
              "q": "Can you trust an online height and weight calculator?",
              "a": "The online height and weight calculator, based on WHO standards, is an accurate tool for preliminary assessment of physical development. However, it is not a substitute for pediatrician consultation and professional evaluation. Accuracy depends on the correctness of the entered data (accurate height and weight measurements, correct age). The calculator uses the same formulas and tables that doctors use, so the results are comparable to a medical assessment."
            },
            {
              "q": "How often do WHO height standards change?",
              "a": "WHO growth standards are updated periodically based on new research and data. The current WHO standards for children 0 to 5 years of age were developed in 2006 based on a multi-year study of healthy breastfed children from different countries. These standards are considered current and are used throughout the world. Large-scale updates occur every 10-15 years, but small adjustments can be made as new data becomes available."

            {
              "q": "What is caliperometry and is it needed to assess growth?",
              "a": "Caliperometry is the measurement of skinfold thickness to assess body composition (percentage of body fat). To assess physical development, height and weight are usually sufficient; caliperometry is used in specialized studies. The Height and Weight Calculator estimates overall physical development using height and weight percentiles, which is the standard for initial assessment. Caliperometry may be useful if overweight or obesity is suspected, but is not included in the basic height calculator."

              "q": "How to interpret height percentiles for children of different ages?",
              "a": "The interpretation of height percentiles is the same for all ages from 0 to 5 years: <5% - below normal, 5-25% - below average, 25-75% - normal, 75-95% - above average, >95% - above normal. However, absolute height values ​​change greatly with age: newborn - ~50 cm, 1 year - ~75 cm, 2 years - ~87 cm, 3 years - ~95 cm, 4 years - ~103 cm, 5 years - ~110 cm. The height calculator takes age into account when calculating percentiles automatically."

              "q": "Do medical conditions affect the results of the height calculator?",
              "a": "Yes, diseases can affect a child’s height and weight, which is reflected in the calculator results. Chronic diseases, hormonal disorders, and genetic syndromes can lead to deviations from normal percentiles. If the calculator results show significant deviations, this may be a symptom of a medical condition. However, the height calculator does not diagnose diseases - it only estimates physical parameters. If you suspect a disease, be sure to consult your doctor."

              "q": "How to use the calculator to assess the development of twins?",
              "a": "For twins, the height calculator is used in the same way as for normal children: enter the gender, age, height and weight of each child separately. However, it is important to consider that twins may be smaller than their peers due to pregnancy factors (multiple pregnancies, premature birth). The growth of twins may be 1-3 cm behind that of single children, which is normal. Assess each twin's development individually, but consider family dynamics."

              "q": "What is the height-weight index and how to calculate it?",
              "a": "The height-weight index is the ratio of weight to height, showing the harmony of physical development. Technically, this is BMI for children, but it is estimated using percentiles by age and sex rather than absolute values. The height calculator automatically estimates weight for height by comparing percentiles of these indicators. If the height and weight percentiles are close (for example, height 50th percentile, weight 55th percentile), development is harmonious."

              "q": "Can the calculator be used to assess the development of children with special needs?",
              "a": "The height calculator is based on standards for healthy children, so results may be less accurate for children with certain medical conditions or special needs. For children with genetic syndromes, chronic diseases that affect growth (for example, Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis), there are specialized growth standards. Use the calculator as a guide, but be sure to consult with a doctor who knows your child's developmental needs."

              "a": "To create a child growth chart, measure height and weight regularly (for example, once a month) and mark the points on the WHO growth chart by percentiles. You can use the height calculator after each measurement to determine the percentile, then mark the point on the graph. Connect the dots and you get a child's growth curve. If the curve follows one of the percentile lines, growth is stable. Sharp deviations of the curve require the attention of a doctor."

              "a": "The calculator's height percentages are only as accurate as WHO standards (based on studies of thousands of children) and the accuracy of the data entered. If height and weight are measured correctly, age is indicated accurately in months (for children under one year old), percentiles will be accurate. The accuracy of percentile determination is usually ±2-3%. However, small errors in measurements (1-2 cm in height, 0.1-0.2 kg in weight) may slightly change the percentile."

For example, at a BAC of 0.5‰, alcohol is eliminated in ~3.5 hours, at 1.0‰ in ~7 hours, and at 1.5‰ in ~10 hours. Women eliminate alcohol more slowly due to differences in metabolism. Complete elimination means a reduction in BAC to 0‰."

BAC is measured in ppm (for example, 0.5‰), the strength of drinks is measured in percentage (for example, beer 5%, wine 12%). For driving in the USA the percentage used is: 0.08% BAC = 0.8‰. The alcohol calculator shows the result in ppm, as this is the standard for most countries."

              "q": "How does gender affect the calculation of ppm of alcohol?",
              "a": "Gender influences the calculation of ppm through the alcohol distribution coefficient (r): for men r = 0.7, for women r = 0.6. This means that for the same amount of alcohol, women will have a higher BAC because they have less water in their bodies and metabolize alcohol more slowly. For example, when drinking 250 ml of 12% wine, a 65 kg woman will receive a BAC of ~0.61‰, and a man of the same weight will receive ~0.49‰. The alcohol calculator takes this difference into account."

For example, with a BAC of 0.75‰: time = 0.75 / 0.15 = 5 hours. The ppm calculator automatically calculates the time for complete elimination to 0‰. It is important to consider that the elimination rate can vary from 0.10 to 0.20‰/hour, depending on individual characteristics."

              "q": "Does body weight affect ppm levels?",
              "a": "Yes, body weight has a significant effect on your ppm alcohol level. For the same amount of alcohol, a heavier person will have a lower BAC because the alcohol is distributed over a larger volume of the body. Widmark's formula takes into account weight in the denominator: BAC = (A / (r × W)) × 1000. For example, with 100 ml of vodka 40%: a 60 kg man will receive a BAC of ~0.75‰, a 90 kg man will receive a BAC of ~0.50‰. The alcohol calculator takes body weight into account in its calculations."

              "q": "How to convert ppm to grams of pure alcohol?",
              "a": "To convert ppm to grams of pure alcohol, the inverse Widmark formula is used: A = BAC × r × W / 1000, where A is pure alcohol in grams, BAC is ppm, r is the coefficient (0.7 men, 0.6 women), W is weight in grams. For example, for an 80 kg man with a BAC of 0.5‰: A = 0.5 × 0.7 × 80000 / 1000 = 28 grams of pure alcohol. This is equivalent to approximately 90 ml of vodka 40% or 350 ml of beer 5%."

              "q": "What do the different ppm levels mean: 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 ppm?",
              "a": "Permille levels correspond to different states of intoxication: 0.0-0.3‰ - sober state, 0.3-0.5‰ - slight relaxation (minimal impact), 0.5-1.0‰ - mild intoxication (initial signs), 1.0-2.0‰ - moderate intoxication (noticeable loss of coordination), 2.0-3.0‰ - severe intoxication (serious dysfunction), 3.0-4.0‰ - severe poisoning (hazardous to health), 4.0‰+ - critical condition (life-threatening).

              "q": "Is it possible to calculate ppm without a calculator manually?",
              "a": "Yes, you can calculate ppm manually using the Widmark formula: 1) Calculate pure alcohol: volume (ml) × strength (%) × 0.789; 2) Determine the coefficient r (0.7 for men, 0.6 for women); 3) Calculate BAC = (pure alcohol / (r × weight in grams)) × 1000. For example, man 75 kg, 500 ml beer 5%: alcohol = 500 × 0.05 × 0.789 = 19.7 g; BAC = (19.7 / (0.7 × 75000)) × 1000 = 0.38‰. The alcohol calculator does this automatically."

              "q": "How does food intake affect the absorption of alcohol and ppm?",
              "a": "Eating food slows the absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream, resulting in a slower rise in BAC and a lower peak level. On an empty stomach, alcohol is absorbed faster, BAC reaches its maximum faster (after 30-60 minutes), on a full stomach - more slowly (after 1-2 hours). Widmark's formula does not take into account food intake, so the calculation gives an average estimate. For a more accurate result, keep in mind that on a full stomach, BAC may be 20-30% lower."

              "q": "What is BAC and how is it different from ppm?",
              "a": "BAC (Blood Alcohol Concentration) is the concentration of alcohol in the blood, measured in ppm (‰). BAC and ppm are the same thing, just ppm is the Russian unit of measurement for BAC. In English-speaking countries the percentage is sometimes used: 0.08% BAC = 0.8‰. The alcohol calculator shows BAC in ppm (‰), which is the standard in Russia and most European countries. 1 ppm = 0.1% = 1 gram of alcohol per liter of blood."

              "a": "A BAC level above 2.0-3.0‰ (severe intoxication) is considered hazardous to health: coordination and speech are impaired, nausea, vomiting, and loss of consciousness may occur. Levels above 3.0-4.0‰ (severe poisoning) are dangerous to health: respiratory depression, risk of aspiration of vomit, risk of injury. Levels above 4.0‰ are critically life-threatening: coma, respiratory arrest, and death are possible. The alcohol calculator shows warnings for dangerous BAC levels."

              "q": "Does age affect the rate at which alcohol is eliminated from the body?",
              "a": "Yes, age affects the rate at which alcohol is eliminated. With age, liver function decreases and metabolism slows down, so older people eliminate alcohol more slowly. Young people (under 25 years old) may have a faster metabolism, but this varies from person to person. The Widmark formula does not take age into account and uses an average elimination rate of 0.15‰/hour. In older people, the rate can be 0.10-0.12‰/hour, in young people - up to 0.18-0.20‰/hour."

Formula: amount of alcohol = (volume1 × abv1 × 0.789) + (volume2 × abv2 × 0.789) + ... Then use Widmark's formula: BAC = (sum of alcohol / (r × weight)) × 1000. For example, 80 kg man: 500 ml beer 5% (19.7 g) + 100 ml vodka 40% (31.6 g) = 51.3 g alcohol; BAC = (51.3 / (0.7 × 80000)) × 1000 = 0.92‰. The alcohol calculator allows you to enter multiple drinks."

For men, r = 0.7 (70% water in the body), for women, r = 0.6 (60% water). Alcohol is water soluble, so women with less water will have a higher BAC for the same amount of alcohol. This coefficient was empirically determined by the Swedish scientist Erik Widmark. The alcohol calculator uses these standard ratios."

              "q": "Can I use an alcohol calculator to determine if I can drive?",
              "a": "The alcohol calculator can be used as a guide, but NOT to make driving decisions. Calculation is approximate and may differ from actual BAC. Even if the calculator shows an acceptable level (for example, 0.3‰), the response may be slow. The safest thing to do is not to drive at all after drinking alcohol. It is better to use a calculator to plan the time after which it is safe to drive (when the BAC is definitely 0‰)."

              "q": "How does alcohol elimination differ between men and women?",
              "a": "In women, alcohol is excreted more slowly due to: lower water content in the body (coefficient 0.6 versus 0.7 in men), lower activity of the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme, and hormonal factors. With the same amount of alcohol in women: BAC is higher (15-20%), elimination time is longer, the effects of alcohol are greater. For example, with 250 ml of wine 12%: woman 65 kg - BAC 0.61‰, excretion ~4 hours; man 65 kg - BAC 0.49‰, excretion ~3.5 hours. The alcohol calculator takes these differences into account."

              "q": "What should I do if my ppm exceeds the legal driving limit?",
              "a": "If the ppm exceeds the permissible limit (in Russia 0.0‰, in most countries 0.5‰), do not drive under any circumstances. Use a taxi, public transport, or ask a sober driver. Wait until the alcohol is completely removed (to 0‰). Calculate your elimination time: if your BAC is 0.8‰, it will take about 5-6 hours to reach 0‰. Remember: driving while intoxicated is a serious crime that results in loss of license and criminal liability."

              "a": "The strength of the drink directly affects the amount of pure alcohol and the ppm level. The higher the strength, the more alcohol in the same volume. Formula: alcohol = volume × strength × 0.789. For example, 500 ml: beer 5% = 19.7 g of alcohol, wine 12% = 47.3 g, vodka 40% = 157.8 g. With the same volume, 40% vodka will give 8 times more ppm than 5% beer. Man 80 kg: 500 ml beer 5% = 0.35‰, 500 ml wine 12% = 0.85‰, 500 ml vodka 40% = 2.81‰. The alcohol calculator takes into account the strength in the calculations."

              "q": "Does the rate of alcohol consumption affect the ppm level?",
              "a": "Yes, rate of drinking affects peak BAC levels. When consumed quickly (in a short time), alcohol is absorbed faster, BAC reaches maximum faster and may be higher. With slow consumption (extended over time), alcohol is partially eliminated during consumption, peak BAC is lower, but the period of increased BAC is longer. Widmark's formula calculates maximum BAC assuming immediate absorption. In reality, when taken slowly, peak BAC can be 10-20% lower."

              "a": "Alcohol remains in the blood until complete elimination, which occurs at a rate of 0.15‰ per hour. The time depends on the BAC level: at 0.5‰ - ~3.5 hours, at 1.0‰ - ~7 hours, at 1.5‰ - ~10 hours, at 2.0‰ - ~13 hours. Women have a longer elimination time due to their slower metabolism. Alcohol is completely eliminated when the BAC reaches 0‰. A breathalyzer may show traces of alcohol 12-24 hours after consumption, but these are residual traces that do not affect the condition."

              "q": "Is it possible to speed up the elimination of alcohol from the body?",
              "a": "No, you cannot significantly speed up the elimination of alcohol from the body. The excretion rate is constant (0.15‰/hour) and depends on liver metabolism. Coffee, cold showers, physical activity do NOT speed up elimination, they may temporarily perk you up, but they do not reduce BAC. The only thing that helps is time. The body must metabolize alcohol through the liver. Some drugs can affect metabolism, but this is dangerous and not recommended. The best way is to wait the required time."

              "a": "The accuracy of the alcohol calculator can be verified by comparison with a professional breathalyzer or a blood test at a medical facility. However, remember that the online calculator gives an approximate estimate using the Widmark formula; actual BAC may differ by ±20-30% due to individual factors (absorption rate, food intake, medications, health status). To accurately determine your BAC, use a professional breathalyzer or blood test. The calculator is useful for planning and rough estimates, but does not replace medical analysis."

              "a": "Residual alcohol is the minimal traces of alcohol in the blood after its main elimination. The residual level is usually below 0.1-0.2‰ and does not affect the condition and reaction. In Russia, the permissible limit is 0.0‰, so even residual alcohol is considered a violation. Residual alcohol can be detected by a breathalyzer within 12-24 hours after consumption, especially after large amounts of alcohol. It takes 24-48 hours after the last drink to completely remove residual alcohol."

The Widmark formula does not take medications into account, so the calculation may not be accurate. When taking medications, it is better not to drink alcohol at all, as it can be dangerous to health. If you are taking medications, the calculator's results may be less accurate."

For example, a 200 ml cocktail with a strength of 15%: use a volume of 200 ml and a strength of 15%. If unknown, calculate the total alcohol of all ingredients: alcohol of the cocktail = sum of (volume of the ingredient × its strength × 0.789), then use the total volume and average strength = (total alcohol / total volume) / 0.789 × 100.

Sugary drinks may slow absorption. However, the type of drink does not affect the final peak BAC - only the amount of pure alcohol does. Widmark's formula does not take into account the type of drink, so the calculation gives an average estimate. The main thing is the strength and volume, not the type of drink."

Foot fullness may vary between brands and countries. Some brands (especially American ones) indicate the fullness of the foot with letters (N - narrow, M - medium, W - wide) or numbers. European brands usually use standard thickness. To accurately select your shoe size, it is recommended to take into account not only the length, but also the fullness of the foot, especially if you have narrow or wide feet. Try on shoes or check specific brand size charts."

For example, if you are wearing an EU 40, choose a JP 13 or 15. Japanese sizing takes into account the body type of the Asian population. Also consider: 1) Read the size tables on the store’s website (girths are often indicated in centimeters); 2) Study reviews about product sizes; 3) When in doubt, choose one size larger; 4) Pay attention to the specific brand's size charts, as Japanese brands may vary."

              "a": "Yes, the ring size converter can be used for signets, rings, wedding rings, engagement rings and any other jewelry that fits on the finger. The converter works with the inner diameter of the ring, which is the same for all types of rings. However, wide signets and rings may require a size 0.5-1 larger due to the increased width and weight of the product. Keep in mind that signets often have a wider frame, so measure the inner diameter where it touches your finger."

              "q": "Does the width of the ring affect the size?",
              "a": "Yes, the width of the ring affects the wearing comfort, so wide rings (more than 6-8 mm) should be 0.5-1 size larger than narrow rings (less than 4 mm). This is because wider rings put more pressure on the finger and can be uncomfortable if the size is too small. For narrow wedding rings (3-4 mm), you can use the standard size. For wide signets and rings (8-12 mm), it is recommended to increase the size by 0.5-1. The converter gives a base size that can be adjusted depending on the width of the ring."

              "q": "Ring size for different fingers: is it different?",
              "a": "Yes, the ring size is different for different fingers due to different finger thicknesses. Usually: the ring finger of the left hand (for a wedding finger) is medium size, the ring finger of the right hand is 0.5-1 size larger, the index finger is 1 size larger, the little finger is 2-3 sizes smaller, the thumb is 3-4 sizes larger. Sizes are individual and may vary.

              "q": "Ring size according to finger length: does finger length affect size?",
              "a": "The length of the finger does not directly affect the size of the ring, since the size is determined by the girth (circumference) of the finger in the place where the ring will be, and not by the length. However, long fingers may have a smaller girth, while short fingers may have a larger girth. The size of the ring depends on the thickness of the finger (girth), which varies individually. The size converter works with the diameter or circumference of a finger, which is independent of length. To determine your exact size, measure the circumference of your finger with a strip of paper or the diameter of your existing ring."
