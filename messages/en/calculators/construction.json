              "a": "The pipe diameter is selected based on the required water flow, permissible flow rate and pressure loss. For residential buildings, pipes with a diameter of 15-25 mm are usually used, for industrial facilities - up to 200 mm or more. Use the formula D = √(4Q/πV), where Q is flow (m³/s), V is speed (m/s)."

            {
              "q": "What factors affect pipe capacity?",
              "a": "The throughput capacity depends on the pipe diameter, material, internal surface roughness, fluid viscosity, temperature and flow regime (laminar or turbulent). The larger the diameter and the lower the roughness, the higher the throughput."

            {
              "q": "How to calculate pressure loss in a pipeline?",
              "a": "Pressure loss is calculated using the Darcy-Weisbach formula: ΔP = λ × (L/D) × (ρV²/2), where λ is the friction coefficient, L is the pipe length, D is the diameter, ρ is the density, V is the speed. Local resistances (fittings, fittings) are also taken into account, which increase losses by 20-30%."

            {
              "q": "What is the difference between laminar and turbulent regimes?",
              "a": "Laminar mode (Re < 2300) is characterized by smooth fluid flow with low energy losses. Turbulent mode (Re > 4000) occurs at high speeds and is characterized by vortex motion with increased pressure losses, but a more stable flow."

              "q": "What is the optimal flow rate for water pipes?",
              "a": "The optimal flow speed for water supply is 1.5-2.5 m/s. A speed of less than 1 m/s can lead to stagnation and sedimentation; a speed of more than 3 m/s increases pressure loss and noise in the system."

              "q": "How does pipe roughness affect pressure loss?",
              "a": "The roughness of the inner surface of the pipe directly affects the coefficient of friction and pressure loss. Plastic pipes have a roughness of 0.0015-0.007 mm, steel - 0.03-0.05 mm, cast iron - 0.1-0.3 mm. The higher the roughness, the greater the pressure loss."

            {
              "q": "What is the difference between the inner and outer diameter of a pipe?",
              "a": "Internal diameter (Din) is the diameter of the pipe flow section, used for hydraulic calculations. Outer diameter (Dout) - the external size of the pipe, takes into account the wall thickness. For calculations, the internal diameter is always used: Din = Dout - 2×S, where S is the wall thickness."
